0,"Overall, effective course."
1,Again Chuck and Bill are great instructors they really helped us to be successful for evaluations.
2,Best FAA Course so far. Great Job!
3,"great course overall, very informative!"
4,Carlos and Teresa were excellent in answering any question and assisting during lab
5,only possible issue is to go over the actual equipment in more detail to identify different aspects of the hardware.
6,The classroom was a good environment free from distractions to allow for the instructors to present the material in the best way possible.
7,Instructor was well-prepared and knowledgeable cooperative
8,"The training I have received is good, but what really is needed is the ability to create RNAV SID."
9,"The course content was very relevant, the instructor should be given more technology and other essential materials to help convey the message and encourage participation."
10,instructors were great (all of them) really showed that they cared about their students and showed that they want us to succeed
11,All good.
12,Jose Salazar and Richard Sacket are great instructors.
13,Both instructors had deep knowledge and previous experience on the subject matter presented. It was presented in an easy to understand way. They were also very courteous and were willing to answer all questions that came up during the training. Very well taught and a good course!
14,Very good instructors. I enjoyed in both courses
15,"Greg and Mike are excellent instructors. Greg has a ton of person experience that makes it easy to connect the dots with the subject, while Mike injects humor and energy that makes it very easy to stay involved and easy for participation."
16,"The course was very informative. I would like other courses to be set up like this. Even though the battery order is subject to be change, all other material was up to date. I feel more clarified by going over the orders. I really enjoy the class."
17,Time discussing an Opportunity to Demonstrate Performance would be helpful.
18,"Instructional staff is very knowledgeable, engaged and proficient."
19,Course material encompassed many topics not applicable to the Performance Assessments or AAC ATCT procedures. The superfluous but important material should be stressed as material that is important and may or may not be applicable to certain facilities.
20,The overall material and organization was well developed and I believe contributed to the successful learning of most students. Providing more visual aid's and hands on would help students better understand some of the material.
21,The course provided a general understanding of aviation in a short amount of time.
22,"Rich Green and Rich Wiggins are great teachers and especially as a team, I am so grateful I had them to learn from."
23,"I am so grateful to have both Rich's as my instructors. They are so knowledgeable, and so dedicated to our success. I would not be able to understand many of the concepts if it wasn't for their teaching style. They come in here everyday and act as if our success is their success an"
24,"The instructors were extremely knowledgeable and effective overall. They occasionally struggled with utilizing the presentation materials (computer, video interfaces), which detracted from their overall effectiveness."
25,"It's a bit too detailed for an ACO ASI. A one day would be more suited for ASIs and would be more cost efficient and effective. Still, the class was well done and it's overall effect was positive. Need? No. An enhancement? Yes."
26,"As with many of the technical training courses I have received through the FAA, I felt that too much time was spent on foundational material, attempting to provide a basic knowledge level of the area of study. I, as well as most of the fellow Inspectors I am attending class with, a"
27,"great instructors, Mr. Stuppiello in particular."
28,Excellent. Good balance of presented information and group discussions.
29,"Most of the course was good, the main problem was with the complexity of the new scenarios."
30,"Daryl Don and Al did a great job. They are great instructors, very knowledgeable, and present the topics well."
31,"1. Recommend that the PTS subject area would be much more complete if it had its own lesson, after all it is a central document for evaluations.2. There does not seem to be any discussion time allotted in the schedule, half of this course is base on strong interaction with the inst"
32,The Simulator provided great training. An additional safety benefit and experience in an actual Technically Advanced Aircraft (TAA) for some enhanced training and practice of subjects covered. At least possibly some extra time designated for an Instrument Proficiency check in the s
33,Outstanding presentations and instruction
34,"All of my lead instructors, Kent Story (basics lead), Mark Sommers (NonRADAR/RADAR lead), and Mike Moravec (NonRADAR/RADAR A-lead) were excellent in their instruction and encouragement of students. They all offered sound advice, knew the subject inside and out, and were open to any"
35,"Overall content of course was effective, however, I would have prefer the course to be more tailored to my domain. I did not appreciate having to learn about tower when I am assigned enroute."
36,I felt the material should have been more geared toward En Route and our instructors should have I more En Route experience. We did seem to have a high turn over of instructors in our class.
37,Instructors were good
38,John Roux was helpful and effective as the lead...Jeff Phillips and Rich Green worked very well with all in the class.
39,outstanding
40,The class was excellent. I think having extra instructors in the class room is a helpful benefit to help students understand through out the exercise processes.
41,see above
42,Excellent.
43,Good Job!
44,"The material was clear, the practice problems were not overwhelming."
45,"Overall, I was very pleased with the pace of this portion of the course."
46,Instructors did a very good job. Very effective.
47,"The class is misnamed. I thought, as many others did, that the class didn't really apply to people wanting to be principle inspectors. It is a helpful class in that instructors shared experiences of being a Principle Inspector, but the course should be more focused on all the dutie"
48,The class got me thinking about how we train our new and incoming team members. We are coming up with a plan to document the training process and what to cover and the time frame involved.
49,Quite effective at having the class participate.
50,"excellent, entertaining"
51,"Hearing tended to be difficult at times when the double room was open. Often, the sound of a squeaking chair or persons passing in the hall made hearing the instructor from the other side of the room difficult/impossible. Consistent use of microphones may correct this?Instructors d"
52,Excellent
53,Our lead instructors were great and would fight for us if we had problems. The lab instructors were very conflicting and would have problems with the way our leads would teach us but it should not be up to them. Also the instructor demo is suppose to be helpful but it could actuall
54,I believe it is highly inappropriate to have students remoting for other students evals. Other students should not be witness to our performance during an evaluation.
55,"Well prepared, well thought out, well instructed."
56,"much more can be taken out, teach where to find the info in the TI"
57,Lead and assistant Lead were awesome. Rest of instructors also make a big impact in training and I think they should be mentioned and applauded for all the patience and effort they put into teaching us air traffic in such a short time. Instructors that made this training amazing we
58,The current instructor teams you have are fantastic. I'm not sure if it was planned but the last 2 courses I attended the instructors were 1 pro and 1 former FAA ATM/DM. Excellent combination and easily related the material and course objectives to what we experience on a daily bas
59,"Instructors were highly knowledgeable, helpful, and patient when running scenarios"
60,Best Instructors I have ever had! Kept my attention...Answered all questions without making me feel silly for asking...AND presented all material in ways that I understood! Thank Yous!
61,I don't have enough good things to say about our lead Roy Harris and our a-lead Joe Stapleton. both have been fantastic.
62,"The academic portion of the class seemed adequately paced, the labs seemed very fast paced and required greater knowledge than what I was equipped with in order to perform at a basic level."
63,"I feel the classroom training could be better done by a well done eLMS course. Then we could travel there to just do the flying part, if desired. Most of the instructors were foreign and English was not their first language so several were very hard to understand"
64,I feel that the course can be shortened by a week or two. With that the students may be able to acquire more time in the TSS lab which I feel that we didn't get enough of at the academy.
65,Excellent presentation of the material with a loosely formatted style so that the specialists felt comfortable asking questions. Valuable training opportunity.
66,There is a lot of information presented in a small amount of time here in the Academics portion of the 50046 course. I feel like wake turbulence needs to be taught earlier and more in depth throughout the course.
67,The instructor's knowledge and experience was an asset to the course.
68,"Rob, Matt, and Jeff were excellent instructors as well as Perry."
69,"Philip Mann did a great job teaching the material and engaging the class with questions and examples. Bill Young did a great job teaching the material, though it was drier in nature. Bill also used questions and examples but asked more rhetorical questions than Phil. Both instructo"
70,There should be computers provided by the FAA to be used in the classroom part of the course and not a requirement to bring assigned laptop computers by the student. This policy should be consistent with the policy for the classes at MMAC at OKC. This risks damage to the assigned c
71,I really enjoyed Kent because he was an en route instructor and gave amazing insight. Most of the instructors were from terminal so they could not give too much experience in the en route area outside of what was in the book. I felt like there wasn't a question about en route that
72,very good course which adds to the knowledge needed while performing my job duties.
73,"The instructors are great, they kept the class engaged, carried us through the day. It was a fun learning experience."
74,"The instructors were very knowledgeable on the subject matter. They were very approachable, they never made the students feel intimidated for asking questions."
75,We were learning easy things very thoroughly but when it came to more difficult scenarios we didn't have a lot a practice scenarios with difficult problems. I feel like the practice scenarios could have been tougher. I feel like the EVAL is going to be much harder than anything we
76,Somewhat agree.
77,The instructors were great however I believe the traffic demand should be decrease to ensure enough time on how and when to apply the proper restrictions.
78,"Though I am this individuals Operations supervisor, he has been with the training department since his arrival. I can not answer any of the above questions."
79,This course was not worth 4 weeks of my life. Please make it a CBI course.
80,"The vast majority of the instructors were very helpful, and taught me a great deal. However, a couple of the instructors had a tendency to want to run my scenarios for me sometimes on some of the later problems. For example, instead of letting me make a late turn and fix it myself"
81,I loved this course! I learned a lot of great things that I can take back to my facility. Definitely feel that this helped me far greater than RTF.
82,"Instructors were professional, obviously VERY knowledgeable, easy to interact with, and seemed to anxious to convey the information required."
83,The instructors were knowledgeable and well versed in the subject.
84,"The development and fielding of Nest Gen technologies is progressing at a rapid pace and field personnel would benefit from having access to a single data source which provides the current status of these technpologies. At present, the information seems to be disseminated by multip"

86,Great attitude and shared experience from the instructors.
87,Instructors did a good job.
88,Course material was good.
89,"The only major complaint I have for the class is the G1 G2 equipment used in lab, it would have been nice to gain practical experience on the equipment I will maintain at my facility. I was offered the opportunity when time allowed access to the ELITE and G4 equipment, which I did"
90,Please review the individual comments above.
91,I was impressed with the knowledge of the instructors. It was great to have instructors with real world experience.
92,"I was very impressed with the level of information provided during this course. I have not been able to work on the equipment by myself as of yet however, I am confident that if tasked could complete the service or repair."
93,Thomas Lynch provided us with all the tools and information necessary to be successful in the written and lab evaluations in this program. With his guidance I never felt like I was missing a concept nor was behind in the program. The A Lead Dave was a great help in the lab portion
94,Very effective. Very professional. Enjoyed the professional leaning environment compared to back home.
95,"This was a very good course, well presented"
96,the slides were made by another instructor but when you use them they are yours and should be presented as if you reviewed them before being taught. If the slides don't give the information that you need add to them to give the information you think is necessary.
97,Course needs more time to be effective! We would like to get an IPC out of this course. More time on POA's. There is no reason we shouldn't get a level 3 from this course. It would have been helpful if there were computers provided in the classroom that would be hooked up to the pr
98,Material useful
99,The instructors were interesting and entertaining. I strongly feel that these courses can be learned via eLMS and that the expense and time can be saved by not having the students travel to OKC.
100,"Overall, the course was very informative. the information presented definitely helped me to understand the Tower Data Link System."
101,The instructors were very approachable and would help with each problem that any student would have to the best of their ability.
102,If we are given more information to learn more time should be given to learn it. Non radar is a difficult course as is and showing scenarios in the practice problems one or two times is not enough practice to master it. More time should be allotted for non radar.
103,I think the non-radar course was structured very well. The pace is fast but if you stay on top of your work and studying it is very doable. The new non-radar problems definitely scaled way faster than anticipated but I can see where they will benefit me on the evaluations tomorrow.
104,not needed but will be useful
105,Russ did a great job explaining the material. Well done.
106,Instructor was effective.
107,Very good coverage of new development software critical to our business
108,Karlie was great. Very knowledgable and able to answer most if not all questions.
109,The course material had recently been re-packaged to modify the materials to be taken by the student. In my opinion more materials should have been made available for the student to make notations on that could be taken following the class. As a practical application workshop I bel
110,"The content of this course was very well constructed, the simulator was a great addition."
111,Don't put CKT 1 near non-radar evaluations it takes away from preparing for evaluations and not having enough time to put in for studying!
112,Awesome class and it was so good to have engaged subject mater experts teaching instead of temp instructors.
113,"All the instructors contributed well overall. I was a little frustrated early on with some instructors ""helping"" run the problem by instructing me to turn a/c, but in the end they explained the reasoning and I learned it."
114,1. Many sections of the course were rushed; this course could be made longer. 2. Legal Council didn't bring much additional information other than what was read from the screen. I was hoping to learn more from him.
115,Mike is extremely knowledgeable with a great attitude and methodology of presentation. Outstanding class
116,"keeping the same instructor would be a wonderful thing, but staffing is an issue from what I understand, it would help with the teaching and learning process!"
117,"I feel the way the course should be more ""real world"" oriented. The way we are taught here at the Academy seems to be a world of difference from the way it is done out in the field. I feel it would be more appropriate to be a little more flexible in the way situations are handled s"
118,"The way radar evaluations are graded at the Academy should, in my opinion, be heavily revised. The FAA spends so much time and money getting students to the Academy, training them for months, and then washes out 10-20% of their students who would make great controllers because of t"
119,"All instructors were extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and willing to address and questions and concerns."
120,The Instructor Michael (used to work Terminal) was a great instructor and really did a nice job.
121,Employee resigned from the agency.
122,"The course content, pace and structure were well done. I appreciate having us learn how to do the work, i.e plotting prior to using the computer."
123,Instructors were excellent.
124,"Repair and service parts should be ordered before class start dates, so theirs no conflict and who's paying foe which items"
125,Closed: Sat
126,Cecil and Mark were always available to answer questions and clarify confusions. Also all the lab instructors were instrumental in my development.
127,The instructors were very helpful. They was some points were the leads and instructors were giving us different information but that was quickly sorted out. Other times it felt that the instructors wouldn't give the student enough time to try to figure it out themselves and just ju
128,"Overall, I feel the course was a fair test to my knowledge and abilities."
129,Kent Story is a wonderful instructor
130,Overall course was great. Learned a lot from all the instructors. Rob Mizell was an excellent lead and instructor as well as Matt and Jeff in the labs. They taught everything we needed to know.
131,Very informative and useful. Great instructors.
132,Good information.
133,Very effective instructors.
134,I enjoyed the End of Course activity.
135,That's it.
136,Roy and Joe were effective at teaching us non radar. Both were extremely knowledgeable in the field of ATC. I look forward to working with them in the radar labs.
137,"Some RPO's were not up to standard during Radar scenarios. The availability of the ""checklist"" lab was a huge help in getting more time on the keyboard. Having students be able to shadow other students runs would help, as this would give us more time in the lab practicing scanning"

139,"Gary was approachable and nice, however sometimes he would get me lost in the way he explained things. He was often very vague or hypothetical. Mac was seldom in class and when he was he did not provide much instruction to the class. I had heard he was a ""non radar legend"" but didn"
140,The information was well explained and paced. The instructor was more than accommodating to ensure all the information being taught was understood and applicable when it came to lab exercises.
141,There was very little pre-study materials available to send to trainees --- that needs to change.
142,Individual is now FPM however the curriculum will be helpful in his current position or if he should leave it.
143,An instructor from another class which was named LeBlanc came into our classroom and stole all of our coffee and other things that we owned. This is not acceptable. We are under enough stress to pass and have a career and we do Not need to be picked on by an instructor who isn't ev
144,"Overall course was presented well, and material was good enough for me to feel like I have basic understanding of the air traffic control system."
145,"The Instructors were all Great, the knowledge and presentation of the material was Great!"
146,This training is optional for the employee
147,"Instead of reviewing appropriation laws, narrow the course down to office level funds certification."
148,"The course instructors were highly effective. They did an outstanding job, especially considering the limitations imposed upon them the issues stated in the comments in the other areas of this critique. They should be designated as OJT trainers and authorized to certify level 1, 2,"
149,One of the best presented classes I have attended.
150,The break out room and labs were a great way to learn radar. Have computers in the class to work on computer message really helped to prepare for the next ERAM problem.
151,Having an instructor with prior flying background combined with his passion for teaching made this course very enjoyable. I felt that the course could be shortened by at least a week. I also felt that the ATC Clearances lesson plan at the very end of the course should be moved clos
152,All instructors I dealt with were very knowledgeable and helpful.
153,INSRTUCTORS WRE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND EXTREMLY HELPFULL.
154,"THIS WAS EASILY AND BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT CLASS THAT I HAVE TAKEN AT THE ACADEMY. RICH AND TOM WERE BOTH EXCELLENT IN THEIR PRESENTATION, KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT, AND WILLINGNESS TO AID THE STUDENTS IN THE CLASS."
155,"Enjoyed the experience, limited budget constraints were overcome by the instructors ."
156,After working the new problems versus the old problems I am happy that we got to work the new scenarios (assuming the evaluations will be more similar to the new scenarios) however I do wish the new scenarios weren't so busy that it hindered my learning at times. We get so busy ans
157,Mac and Gary were great instructors who really knew the best ways to teach the course.
158,great job
159,Best class I have had since I have worked for the FAA.
160,I do not have low pressure chillers at my facility. That being said the course was informative and the instructors knew their stuff.
161,"The main instructors, Thomas and Mark, were very helpful and knowledgeable. They did a good job answering questions and trying to come up with ways to help us prepare for evals. A couple of the instructors helping with the problems were less so. Wes, for example, seemed very harsh"
162,"we were the first class to be provided the ""new"" non-radar practice problems (NR14-NR26). What I have heard from previous classes is that this should help us to understand the evaluation problems and I agree that the new more difficult problems where important though I feel that we"
163,"The lead instructors Rich and Rich were knowledgeable and easy to approach with questions.The row instructors were very helpful in learning, but were not always on the same page as the lead instructors in terms of how to say or do certain things which led to confusion."
164,The instructor taught me a lot.
165,"The amount of passion shown through the instructor was pleasing. You could tell he was there to help in any way he could. He broke down material in a way, I'm sure, everyone could understand. It's nice to be encouraged and know the person teaching you genuinely cares."
166,The course was informative and helped to understand all ATC concepts needed to be successful in the field.
167,Overall I wish we would have touched on more Air Traffic Control topics and less on the instruments of an aircraft and pilot subjects.
168,"We had several instructors, and names are not my strong suit. Kent Story stood out to me as an exceptional instructor. He enjoyed the material (even the self admittedly boring material) and presented it in a way that was easy to understand and kept my attention throughout the lesso"
169,Course was excellent. The content has a slight bend to conduct. It would be helpful to discuss more corrective actions around poor performers.
170,"The labs could some times be tedious. Suggest changing the labs to different types of scenarios such as outside measurements of towers, reviewing models, etc. Also, we would have all liked to keep a model of the airspace. If you are worried about cost increase the cost of this cour"
171,"Great course, wouldn't change a thing"
172,Effective
173,Roy and Joe were overall good instructors. Roy works very hard to help us out. Joe you can tell cares very much about the class's success. I have appreciated having both instructors. Joe does need someone to keep him on track however. Roy would usually have to keep him on target du
174,"Instructors were very effective. You can tell they wanted to be here and wanted us to succeed, which I think pushed many students to try and be better."
175,The instructors did what they can sometimes contradicting each other but that's to be expected they are not hear to take the course for you so like I said everything is giving to you its for you to apply it.
176,meehhh +1
177,Very knowledgeable instructor's who really knew there stuff.
178,"Dave is very knowlegde, passionate, and very funny that he brings a very energized atmosphere in to the class. By just that it made the class very enjoyable to be in."
179,The instructors did a very good job for a class that is a knowledge based course.
180,Course was helpful.
181,"The instructors that come in for labs only, would sometimes teach us things that our lead would advise us not to do, and that is very counterproductive in many cases."
182,"Everything was good, well organized, props to the instructors for making the best use of time, since this amount of material requires more days."
183,Course was good to get the feel of web opss.
184,Learned the importance of repetivness in instruction and the importance of following a lesson plan
185,There is a large amount of information that is presented in the course. More time than 5 days would be beneficial for the students.
186,"Instructor explained the system in very easy, understandable terms."
187,The instructors were the best.
188,Rich and Rich were great. Learned a great amount of material from them.
189,"Employee completed an Enforcement package, which required only minor review."
190,Good
191,"Great course, great instructors, great information!! Only one thing I would do is have AFS-760 do more than review foreign pilot information. I would suggest a mil-comp, their documents, type ratings, etc."
192,Finally a course relevant to my job requirements.
193,"The course seemed a little short, there was a great deal information put out."
194,Very useful for someone that is just starting out in TMU
195,The instructors kept the class engaged. They are very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.
196,"The only other class that I have received that was nearly as effective as this was a Flight Safety Emergency Evacuation class in Georgia(non-FAA). The course presented this material in a way that gave me excellent background followed by real, practical steps to take in managing my"
197,"I really enjoyed my main instructor Michael Baptiste. His way of teaching really helped me reinforce my learning. I felt it was unfair that we did go through 5 secondary instructors in this month of training. I understand why Charles and Rick had to go, but why were we given 2 diff"
198,"The instructors are very helpful, they know the material extremely well and have the ability to teach it in a manner that is well understandable."

201,"Fire Paul Martinez.Pay the instructors, RSO's, and RPO's more. Stop subcontracting the RPO's, it creates unnecessary complications between management at the contractor/FAA level. I think that it is unfair that tower students run 7 scenarios a day, they should run 6 scenarios a day"
202,"Glen was so great! He really knows his stuff well and if he wasn't sure about something, he made sure to get the right answer. Ric was good as well."
203,I enjoyed working with most of the r sides in the radar lab. There was an r side who made it hard to concentrate on the problem due to talking to other r sides or instructors or acting annoyed if I was behind in the problem. It makes running a problem hard to run because of the ext
204,Content and material were overall straight forward.
205,The course was presented in a well organized plan.
206,Superb Instructors who knew their stuff and ENJOYED teaching us and passing on the info for us to flourish in the fleet.. Great Job!!
207,Good Job for the Instructors teaching. :)
208,Exelent
209,Great instructors. They knew their material and were really nice to learn from.
210,"Tim and Rainer are two of the best instructors I have had. They are very knowledgeable, friendly and know how to make this subject appealing to the different levels of expertise that each participant had. Excellent work guys."
211,The lesson plans about vectoring should NOT be included since we DO NOT use that information at all. It takes time away from learning information pertinent to succeeding in this course.
212,None
213,"Rob's humor helped me get through the boring lectures. His teaching style kept me more awake and interactive. My instructors in the lab were Ron and Pete. Both are solid, knowledgeable instructors who genuinely wanted to help me get better. I have zero complaints about either of th"
214,The class was an excellent review of previous material I have covered outside of the FAA. My only recommendation would be to add an additional day for better pacing.
215,They all did great.
216,The course would have been more effective if it was longer. I feel like I would be a more efficient technician with more time with the equipment.
217,Excellent course. A lot of data entry.
218,Excellant
219,"Once the course information is updated, the class will be a great piece of instruction."
220,I think the students would benefit with an extra day or two with the harder problems to prepare for the evaluations. By the time you get to the more difficult scenarios you jump right away into the evaluation.
221,Some of the instructors were very helpful and it was obvious that they want you to succeed and to learn as much as you can with the time they have with you. Where as others weren't as helpful and pretty much let you figure stuff out on your own regardless of if they saw that it was
222,I didn't like how the course was formatted. The way it was taught was we quickly read the chapters as a group and then worked through problems. A lot of times in the problems we were doing stuff before reading the chapter on it. If it was done in reverse it would be better. Without
223,"COURSE WAS SOMEWHAT APPROPRIATLY PACED. LABS WERE A LOT OF FUN. I'M GLAD OUR CLASS WAS SHOWN NEW MATERIAL TWO DAYS BEFORE THE EVAL WITH THE NEW PROBLEMS, HOWEVER I'M NOT SURE IF IT GOT US READY OR WE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO APPLY THESE NEW PROBLEMS FOR THE EVALS."
224,Ripped off by Jiffy lube by 23rd and MacArthur.
225,"The Instructors were awesome, I always enjoy classes that are taught by Mr. Salazar. He is a great instructor with a lot of background that is useful to us back in the field."
226,"both instructors did well with explain material, they seemed rushed for time in teaching the material."
227,"Great Class, very useful info. Need to update powerpoint slides."
228,Lots of interaction and ways to practice the skills.
229,Mike and Greg did an excellent job presenting the information in an entertaining way.
230,"The instructors were great! Different, as we all are, but all were able to teach me! Great group!"
231,Good course. Liked the hands on training available.
232,I feel the content was OK
233,One of the best FAA classes I have attended. Instructors were great.
234,"The instructors were very knowledable and approachable. I think I would benefit from additional constructive criticism . . . I want both positive and negative feedback. My briefing was well received, but I strive to do better each time I present the material."
235,Great course. Flowed at a good pace. Never felt rushed as a student. Generated a lot of good information.
236,I feel that we need to get into the radar labs sooner than we did or extend how long the labs are. Also the strip marking book is excellent for Non-Radar but needs upgraded for Radar. There are only 2 or 3 examples in the strip marking guide to look at.
237,The course is overwhelming and I strongly think it needs to be extended one more week. Basics can be consolidated to four week and that extra week should be used for something as complex as non radar.
238,I think the course is very well planned and was effective for my learning.
239,Chuck is a professional instructor and an asset to the FAA. I appreciate him sharing his experiences and he was very receptive to everyone. He is consistently easy to be with and learn from.
240,Both Thomas Lynch and Mark Sycle are extremely helpful teachers. They are professional and masters of the material. Enthusiastic about helping the students learn and pass the program.
241,I wish there was a practice lab after class where I could stay on campus and study. I don't have a strip board where I live and it would have been nice to practice more here. In my CTI school we were allowed to access the lab anytime we want and practice.
242,Mac & Gary we're great.
243,Russ did an excellent job!
244,"very good instructor, he was professional and very knowledgeable of the subject"
245,Excellent instructors with a very good understanding of aeronautical charting applications. they kept the class engaged.
246,The instructors for this course kept things lively and interesting. They had experience in this subject and were able to give real life examples of the subjects they discussed.
247,the instructors were knowledgeable and helpful
248,"Content was good, however, having dual monitors would greatly enhance efficiency and the learning environment."
249,Met my expectations and covered many of the areas I deal with currently in my office where I have felt lacking in knowledge.
250,Larry Ross was extremely knowledgeable and had a great presence for presenting the material. Bob Enoch also did an excellent job.
251,"Great attitudes and interaction. Again, good class."
252,"Cecil and Mark were excellent and went above and beyond to help me succeed. Phil, Glenn, Ron, Rick, Tim and Joe Armstrong were always going out of their way to help in any way they could and I really appreciated that."
253,"Overall, most instructors were very knowledgeable of the subject material. There were times when it would have been more helpful for Kent to teach a particular lesson due to his background of being a pilot as well as an ATC specialist. Many times the instructor deferred to Kent for"
254,"There should be more emphasis placed on phraseology towards the beginning of class. Also, there should be exercises or more emphasis from instructors about using the correct phraseology throughout the length of the class."
255,The instructors were well prepared and entertaining.
256,This course is very informative but slightly outdated. As the NAS starts to incorporate new systems there should be some training put forward of its arrival not waiting until it is 40% in place already.
257,More hands on training.
258,Excellent course - very helpful!
259,The course was very enjoyable except for the exercises. I especially liked the Jeopardy game and of course the Airbus Simulator. Being able to see this technology in the Airbus was highly effective. I also thought the use of eLMS courses was a good use of our time for those that we
260,The instructor was highly efficient in the teaching of the course. Made topics easy to understand and was involved with the students. Very satisfied with the performance from the instructor.
261,"I am a front line manager, so technically the training is not required for me. I found the course, however, to be helpful and insightful."
262,Execellent
263,The course materials are relevant and important. I'd suggest including an overview for eLMS administration since this is also part of the 3120-1 and AT Training. A demonstration is better than nothing (especially since HQ is mandating completions for Recurrent Workshops in eLMS). P
264,"I thought Chuck did well in presenting what can be a rather dry subject in a way that kept things moving and without getting too much ""power point overload"". The times to work through things using the TRAX program itself as well as to ask site specific questions was invaluable."
265,The student would benefits more if they includes more interaction group activieties instead of lecturing for most of the day.
266,"Some of the course organization could be improved. It would be helpful to talk about a 44709, then write a POA for one, and then use that POA in the practice exercise. Then move on to a more complex POA. Working simple to complex would have been more effective for me. Instead we wr"
267,Fred and Jason were great instructors and always took there time to explain the concepts.
268,Geared more to the FPT functions.
269,"Excellent knowledge of subject matter, and kept the class on point."
270,Great
271,The instructors did pretty good during lecture to try to keep us interacting and engaged.
272,"My job currently does not require TARGETS; however, it may in the future."
273,"Thomas Lynch and Mark Sickle are excellent, knowledgeable and helpful instructors. Very pleased I have them instructing me for these 3 months. Have heard stories of other instructors not quite this caliber and can't help but wonder about how that impacts their career's. As far as e"
274,"It is a lot of material in a short period of time. Take all of the information and applying it to the job is a lot of work. The new scenarios are great if they are like the scenarios in the evaluations. However, because they are so new they are still working out the kinks in them."
275,Jeff and Dave are both amazing instructors. They were very knowledgeable and cared greatly about our progress throughout this program. It was apparent that they wanted all of us to succeed. Both instructors were always asking us if we had any questions and would encourage us to ask
276,Excellent and very well presented by instructors who have passion for the subject.
277,"This course was very helpful to me and I am so grateful to have been able to participate in it. Although I graduated from a CTI school, some time has passed since I was last familiarized with the subject matter. I truly believe this course will help me to be successful in the next"
278,Teamwork should be done after the final and should be taken off the basics practice assessment exam. Very detailed content but the class overall could be shortened. Some lessons that are 7 hours don't need 7 hours.
279,I thoroughly enjoyed the class and believed that it helped enhance my knowledge of aviation and learn some basic information that I will be required to know. I do wish that we would have had a set instructor during the basic course so that we would not have jumped around with diffe
280,"Kent is an excellent instructor and should be an example for other contractors employed by the FAA. The difference between Kent and other instructors was extraordinary - he was prepared, engaging, and approachable. When Kent was moved to teach certain lessons to other classes I fel"
281,VERY EFFECTIVE COURSE.
282,very well presented by instructors
283,"Helpful, knowledgeable, and wouldn't change a thing."
284,"Well prepared, well thought out, well instructed."
285,None.
286,"Bob, Mike, and Al were all very helpful. They took time to answer individual questions, demonstrate, and explain various tasks in the lab. Thanks for the excellent team of instructors."
287,"Overall the course has been highly effective to get me ready to take my evals. I think a couple of the lessons in the classroom portion of the class were not very relatable to what we need to know for the labs, ie radar vectoring. We never use radar vectoring here but when it comes"
288,The overall course provides you with the knowledge to pass you are the one to put in the effort. I have been told that the R-Side and ghost pilots are top of the line for evals unfortunately they are not during your lab training which can pose a problem if you have a horrible probl
289,Very effective! Enjoyed all of them and think the varying styles and backgrounds made for a more enjoyable experience. Looking forward to working with them throughout string training.
290,The instructors were knowledgeable and approachable. Always willing to answer questions. I liked that Larry pulled up the actual OpsSpecs and showed us the current selections available.
291,"The point system for my class was 10 points for academics, 2 LC (30 points each), and 2 GC (15 points each). Total points was 100 and points needed to pass was 70+. The thought of failing one local can determine whether you pass or failed and it is easy to have a bad run or a good"
292,The name of the course is deceiving. The course was excellent but not what I was expecting. I expected a class on opsecs and manual writing.
293,"This course is managed by AFS-500, but there are no questions above that provide comment for improvement of AFS-500 with regard to this course. Scheduling and any scheduling difficulties should be specifically addressed in these critiques."
294,More emphasis on flight inspection procedures
295,I found this to be a very good course. I do not have a RADAR background and I felt that I now have a basic understanding.
296,Instructors Charlie Manbeck and Mike Smith were extremely helpful with the coarse material. Had a lot of knowledge to share.
297,Dave was a great instructor. He was patient with questions and extremely knowledgeable. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
298,Instructors were AWESOME! It was refreshing to have instructors that were passionate about the material and subject of the course. Great job!CLOSED -- SAT (Learning occurred)
299,The course was easy to understand especially for people coming from off the street such as myself.It was a little slow at times but not too bad. Quite a few typos in the reading material but nothing major.
300,more hands on learning and visual aids would be helpful
301,Rich and Rich were fantastic instructors that are very good at what they do. They work well together and both teach the same way making for less confusion when learning concepts. I feel our class was very lucky to have such great instructors and I hope our class success rate will r
302,Both Rich Green and Rich Wiggins were very helpful in all aspects. If there was a problem or question they took care of it promptly.
303,Instructors were knowledgeable.
304,I came in completely off the street so I enjoyed all of the content and found it all to be interesting and helpful.
305,Overall the course was helpful.
306,Both instructors were highly knowledgeable about content.
307,Mr. Kennedy was very knowledgeable in this class to have as an instructor. He went above and beyond to make sure that our whole class knew the processes for what to do in each area for administrative training.
308,"Stressing the importance of, and having instructors grade, controller judgment issues earlier in the scenarios would help students have a better understanding of priorities. I never once got told something was a higher priority and should of been accomplished first in a scenario as"
309,"I feel like I didn't really gain a true understanding of what nonradar was until we began in the labs, and it felt like by that point it was too late for me to catch up. While I think my lead and asst lead were both great instructors, I just wish we had more one on one time with th"
310,"The presented data was a little dated. It would have been nice to have individual lab/workstations.The course may have been able to compress into 3 instead of 3.5 days, unless there was more lab time."
311,"I like how Mac and Gary were hard on us. At first I thought it was too much but I rolled with it and at the end I think it helped me learn better. I did not want to disapoint Mac and Gary since they gave so much effort to us, I felt like I needed to give just as much effort back."
312,"As a novice speaker, I found this course enriching and informative."
313,Tim should not tell as many stories about Empire Airlines
314,Having several different instructors through the course greatly impacted the learning ability of our class. Several students have complained of having several different instructors with limited or no knowledge of the course material. I understand instructors need to start at some p
315,"Ken would confuse the material a few times a day. Mike G's lesson's were less than exciting and therefore sometimes difficult to follow. Karlie, Pat Young, and Mike Ortega were very engaging and made learning easy."
316,"We had a variety of instructors during this course. Each brought their own personality and experience. Our main instructor, Karlie, was excellent overall. I really appreciate her perspective as a pilot."
317,great guys ever helpful good pace and was a positive learning experience
318,The course was good.
319,"My personal opinion is AJV (former director) wasted 100 Million on IPDS rather than upgrade IAPA which was the only CERTFIED TERPS system. When that failed senior leadership, having a slant toward air traffic after all the reorganization decided to use TARGETS. But this system will"
320,"One of the better courses I have attended. All the info seems to be usable for my job. FLMs should take this class, other than TRAX, all the info would be usable to them."
321,Content good. Thanks.
322,I feel that there should be more group activities assignments for the class.
323,Sometimes it would be more helpful to have a written lesson or exercise first that duplicates almost identical to the slides first. Sometimes the first exercise would have different criteria then the example in the slide thus making it a little harder. Then the next exercise could
324,"I have enjoyed my training while at the academy, however I do wish we had more time actually training in the area that actually decides if we get hired or not. We are expected to be radar experts after only 4 weeks in a radar lab where we only actually run problems 2 hours out of t"
325,Somewhat agree.
326,The instructors were great. Rich and Jack were great instructors and very approachable. They really care about the effectiveness of the class. I do however think the material needs to be easier or the length of time given to teach us the material needs to be extended. It was too mu
327,"perhaps more time spent working feeder alone, and final alone. with fewer scenarios where they are combined."
328,"For me, class could have been lengthened considerably to aid in my learning/understanding the vast amount of info"
329,I would have enjoyed a longer course - to learn the program better. only two days was a bit rushed and I believe an additional 1-2 days would have been much better.
330,The moch trail was a great representation of what to expect from an actual trail. It was a great experience.
331,Good class!
332,Block exams didn't necessarily reflect my knowledge of the subject - my ability to perform the job does not equate to my ability to read and retain minute details from the text that will either not be applied here or will be more focused on at my facility. Application and knowledge
333,"All of the instructors were very helpful and when they lacked definitive answers to our questions, they were very good about finding one for us. All of the instructors who had forced the class to engage in dialogue or perform examples of the course material were the most effective,"
334,"Approachable, friendly, knowledgeable"
335,None
336,"Overall the course was good, but the first day and the last day were full of a lot of busy work. Transferring all the orders to chart paper was just empty time, and on the final day, the review wasn't helpful, and the exam should have been administered after the TRAX practical was"
337,"Instructors were very effective, I, because of my hearing had difficulty hearing at times."
338,RTF has been a great experience. While the skills I have learned here may not directly translate to my level 6 facility I'm sure these skills will come in handy once I transfer to a higher facility.
339,The scenarios could be scaled to a higher difficulty in a more efficient way. Also additional practice running NR problems is necessary in order to achieve a proficient level. Access to an after hours lab room would also help getting more practice in.
340,More radar problem
341,All instructors were very well informed and they were able to assist me in learning this system. I think the gencosystem employees were great.
342,The material was perfect and so was the overall pace.
343,Overall basics was a good experience and taught some new material for myself. Other material was a nice review of previously learned lessons.
344,It would have been more effective if we had actually trained on the version of STARS Elite we were going to be working on at our sites
345,continue to update the material so it reflects current real world situations.
346,There were many words spoken. I remember some of them. Less words would be preferable.
347,both instructors did a superb job! did an excellent job presenting and conducting the class.
348,Course could definitely be revamped I feel to help create more successful controllers. Plenty of time to learn study and understand the map and not enough time to learn how to apply the map to what you need to do.
349,Great knowledgeable instructors. One of the best lead courses.
350,"Even though the course description mentions that this is not a technical course, I feel the title of the course gives attendees a pre-conceived thought of what they would expect the course to be about. I highly recommend the course title be changes to something such as ""Foundations"
351,The Instructors did an excellent job presenting the material available to them and promoted class participation and learning. They were very helpful.
352,"SPAS under EIS has a GOOD SNAAP/ Bad SNAAP Regulation selection which is very helpful when employees are trying to find the correct regulation. The employee did not know about this site. The regulation in the case is Title 14, Part 91, section 91.13 (a) and (b), one is for air navi"
353,The instructors were great and had a lot of examples of both good and bad en route situations.
354,"Overall positive influence toward learning experience, with the added real life examples. Just wanted more ways to understand complex ideas in simpler form."
355,This course helped me to apply different skills in dealing with employees. As a FLM wanting to move up in the agency this course was very helpful. Well presented and a good class interaction.
356,great interactive feedback
357,Strongly believe the matter I learnt will be very usefull to me while performing my Job Functions.
358,Chuck Kennedy was an excellent instructor. He was able to give me all materials and knowledge that I need in order to perform day to day tasks.
359,The instructors were very effective
360,This class was great. The instructions were well presented and the expectations were reasonable. The instructors were very helpful and answered all our questions and made sure that we understood their answers.
361,"Jeff and Dave were brilliant instructors. They prepared us greatly for the scenarios and were very knowledgeable when questions were presented. They were motivating, helpful, and well prepared to teach the course."
362,The networking was great. I learned a lot about that. The unix labs need to be updated. I also would like a paper copy of the lab and student guide. It is very hard to take the notes on the computer while trying to listen or do the lab. Better explanation of the lab steps would be
363,The overall course was presented and formatted well. Some lesson plans were allotted more time than may have been necessary to present the information.
364,"It wasn't required, but it was an amazing course and has already helped me in my current position."
365,maybe add a slower scenario that allows for vectoring around weather to provide that more realistic experience.
366,No written assessments were provided.
367,The instructors here in radar definitely were key to skills I acquire. I noticed a big difference in he learning experience with the instructors during radar compared to nonradar. They always went above and beyond to explain something if it wasn't clear. I always looked forward to
368,I think the content was good. The problems I had are personal. My that I mean it just takes awhile for things to soak in for me. I need to be able to put them into practical use and then the light bulb will come on. The course itself was good.
369,Content of the course was adequate and the material was organized effectively to promote a complete understanding of the system.
370,"I had this training previously in the US Navy. If not for the prior training, my answer would be Yes."
371,"This was a very hot course. There was very little down time, as a matter of fact some sections I was working on review questions right up until test time. The instructors were very knowledgeable. The lab section was very good and challenging. The lab practicals were very difficult"
372,"Well designed and preformed to students, easy to navigate trough complete studying material."
373,This course needs part 91 non certificated exercises
374,This was one of the best and one of the most useful courses I've taken at the MMAC. It has been very helpful.
375,"there should be questions that are relevant for me to answer, question 6 asks how satisfied were you with this course, I wasn't present. My employees management skills have grown since his participation."
376,some of the Power Point Presentations and lab exercises were wrong or inaccurate
377,Good course to have the knowledge for our job in the future.
378,My computer did not have enough memory so it was difficult to catch up with the class once IT had corrected the problem. I'd like to have the opportunity to take the course again in the near future with others that work in my same area. This will allow us to focus on those applicat
379,This program should have been used many years ago. much easier to use and is easily manipulated.
380,Both instructors were very knowledgeable of the Chiller Systems.
381,One of the best practical classes I have ever has at the Academy.
382,very disappointed not to have a disc with links and guidance summaries
383,Cecil and Mark are both great instructors. They deserve a raise!
384,"Ceicil and Mark are both very helpful and personable. Ceicil does an excellent job keeping us engaged and focused on key points and working knowledge, while Mark relates course material to real world experience with very helpful connections."
385,"Almost all data in textbook was up to date and accurate, instructor was aware of anything not correct and let us know. Typos here and there."
386,Great instructor team. Effective.
387,"WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TIME CONSTRAINTS, HOWEVER I FEEL THAT IF THE PLOTTING PORTION WERE INTRODUCED ON BLANK GRIDS, PRACTICE PLOTTING THE COORDINATES, AND THEN INTRODUCED ON THE QUAD/SECTIONAL CHARTS, IT MIGHT GIVE THE STUDENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PR"
388,Fred was very effective but none of the other instructors taught anything.
389,"Fred Erolin provided great instruction to a very large group of students! He was attentive, informative, and keep the flow of information going in a positive direction. The content and course material matched perfectly with the intended outcomes and it helped me better understand t"
390,maybe add the RCE into the actual course.
391,Course needs to be restructured. Overall success of student is greatly hindered due to curriculum and pace of course.
392,Thomas Lynch is an effective instructor and I don't think he could have explained the concepts any better.
393,"IF PROBLEMS WERE CHANGED THEN INSTRUCTORS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THEM SO THEY COME PREPARED TO TEACH AND NOT SEEM CONFUSED ON SOLVING NEW PROBLEMS. AT TIMES INSTRUCTORS WOULD RETURN FROM BREAK SAYING"" REMEBER HOW WE DID THIS IN THAT PROBLEM WELL IT WAS WRONG"" THAT DOES NOT REFLECT WELL"
394,I thought the overall course was helpful but I don't think it was enough to be prepared for the new scenarios we received this week. The scenarios were hard enough to the point where it was difficult to do the scenarios effectively.
395,"MOST of the instructors were more than helpful. we had some wonderful PATIENT people. JIM ARMSTRONG, Glenn, Phil, Bobby, Tim and Gayla, Gary, Dan, and Dwight were AMAZING!!! Of course Cecil and Mark were more than wonderful to work with I believe they put us in a great position to"
396,Everything was great.
397,"Our lead instructor Kent was fantastic. Many of us often say to each other that if we had anyone else, we would be in trouble. I couldn't recommend him more. Many others teaching methods, from reading word for word from the book to explaining questions in an aggressive, don't quest"
398,Video repetition was a bit much on the MEL Assessment aircraft video.
399,Some of the exercises need to be more specific.
400,The course was the correct length and was very comprehensive. The instructors were very knowledgeable.
401,Bill Hormann is a very good instructor. He cares about what he does and makes all efforts to make sure you understand whats being taught
402,"most instructors were very helpful, especially ""UNCLE CAL"". Some of the instructor would get frustrated with the students which did help the students."
403,"Would like to see all ERAM services included in this course. CRAD, CFAD and ADSB."
404,"Ron King and Matt Rowley were very knowledgeable. Their presentations were easy to follow. A lot of subject matter was dry, but both strived to make the lessons lively."
405,yep
406,"Great Course overall, finale written test could have been written better, the material that was to help, was very hard to find information for exam."
407,"I feel more time could be spent troubleshooting issues with the lights, ILC's, and transformers in the runways since most of the problems I have encountered have of this nature."
408,He was on a detail.
409,All the instructors were excellent and kept us engaged. My recommendation would be to have them wear microphones at all times so everyone can hear.
410,Great Instructors!
411,Great class gained alot of knowledge
412,Add more detailed info on Unit 11 and the interaction with the receiver cabinets via the LPC.
413,Thomas was a good instructor. Helpful. Sought to make sure all principles were understood even when they had been previously explained multiple times.A lead Dave. A good chap. Helpful. Valuable insight.Mark Sickle. Good instructor. Very Helpful.Radar Instructors: Mary was a little
414,"We were the first class to receive the new non-radar instructional problems. The new problems were definitely challenging and I believe they will be good preparation for the evals. The newer problems should, however, start a little earlier than problem 14. I have heard that they ar"
415,I wish we would have more practice problems prior to EVALS.
416,Was given more than necessary time for non-radar but not near enough time for radar. Radar is what decides your career for the FAA and it seemed rushed. The instructors did everything necessary to help us and provide the necessary training for the evaluations.
417,I must say I did learned a lot from this course it was stressful and definitely challenged me everyday to the point of crying every time I got home. the lessons plans were very fast paced. I felt like 2 weeks of training fro the scenerios was not enough time. the organization of th
418,Great course. Should be offered to all inspectors.
419,"More scenario based training, including compliance philosophy and legal ramifications along with practical communication skills."
420,The classroom was freezing other than that everything was great. Wake Turbulence would have been nice to learn a couple weeks sooner.
421,"Overall instructors were effective, but there was one that seemed to fall below the curve"
422,"Great class, great instructors."
423,"Good Instructors, they had good knowledge of the material."
424,The radar portion of this course was better paced than the non-radar portion. The radar labs increased in difficulty at a good rate adding great training value to the course. The few improvement opportunities include; instructors should not get too advanced during the message entry
425,"Overall, I believe the course went by very quickly and I think it would have been beneficial to have the course extend a couple more days to about a week to make sure the students are understanding/learning all the material and not just being thrown into them during the situations"
426,The Instructors were very well organized.
427,Most of the instructors had a good sense of knowledge of all the material. They made the course enjoyable and went above and beyond the scope of helping everyone get to the same level.
428,Both instructors did an outstanding job of presenting the information and facilitating the learning process
429,"The best part of the class was preparing for and presenting a briefing. There is no better way to become a better instructor than through practice and repetition, no matter how proficient you are with the material."
430,"The course is not given in the most beneficial order (in my opinion). It should parallel the steps and order that someone actually building the procedure would take. Since it does not, there was a lot of jumping around and explaining why in real life you would approach things diffe"
431,Initial courses are always difficult because there is no prior knowledge. Russ presented the course in a way that related the course to experience.
432,"Course time allotted was minimal, but the instructor made great use of the time. The problems and examples used in the course helped reinforce the learning of departures on targets."
433,"I do not think I would have had the same experience if we had been given different instructors. I think they both love their jobs and that comes through in their instruction. They are professional, yet friendly. Great guys, even better instructors."
434,very knowledgeable instructors
435,The instructors were knowledgeable about the subject matter and were helpful throughout a course that was challenging.
436,Course was very informative and actually pretty fun.
437,Felt that the material on the book was all over the place. Instead of the final grade being based on one final one wished it was an average of all the block test.
438,I understood the instructor was a retired FAA person that brought many good LMR examples to the class for discussion. I actually had the same course and instructor a month later and he did a great job.
439,EHOT and DOP Added
440,Good Course. Would have preferred EHOT/DOP. Did not enjoy hauling my MDT here just to install some software (that only took 10 minutes.)
441,Effective
442,"only thing I would like is if we had an Ipad to use to follow along on reading TI's since this system is taught electronically and bounces around to numerous TI's. And the screen is behind the student, so I would have to turn around a lot. Also there isn't much desk space to put pr"
443,"The course and lectures were good. I found the tests to be have decent relevance, but found that they focused more on finding phrases inside of procedures rather than focus on system mechanics. I would like to see techs knowledge base on the technical aspect of the equipment increa"
444,Very helpful and knowledgeable
445,All of the instructors were able to effectively teach the information in the course. I enjoyed having many different instructors. You hear different perspectives and real world examples. It also keeps class interesting when you get to listen to somebody new.
446,I believe this course is very helpful to students and I recommend it students in the future. However I feel that it had far more terminal related information the En Route. It would be beneficial to have it directed for the option of the class.
447,none
448,"The instructors were very helpful. The environment was great, I was not hesitant to ask any questions."
449,The instructors were awesome. Really helped us to understand some pretty advanced material. They also provided us many opportunities to run our scenarios to get them done perfectly.
450,VERY INFORMATIVE.
451,Instructors were helpful and answered all questions in a timely manner.
452,More On-hands Antenna Training
453,"I had very good experience with all instructors, they are always there to help, explain lecture on the best way that student can understand and preform same task in the lab. Good job, big thanks to all instructors on this course."
454,Was unable to attend class. This is the second time for me to reply to th is letter. Thank you. David L. Miller
455,Great job.
456,I thought this class was highly organized and thought out. Considerations were given to many critical areas and of aspects of training.
457,More room when writing on the bigger charts would be nice. It was difficult to try to plot on the narrow desk.
458,larger monitors
459,Update the course to include new features
460,"This was a good course overall, small group setting is definitely the best."
461,"I feel like most of the instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful. However, there were some instructors who weren't up to date with changes to the academy rules such as: LOA's SOP's etc. It did not affect my training much only caused a few conflictions about what was right."
462,"Both were professional, obvious SME's, enjoyed time with them."
463,It would have been nice to have the harder problems to be practice evaluated on since what I consistently hear is the evaluations are significantly harder than the most difficult practice problems. It would make more sense to train at a higher level than being evaluated on.
464,he works in a terminal environment
465,"Over all, the learning experience was satisfactory."
466,Course was great could use more time on the ATC aspect rather than admin areas and less pilot areas
467,"PIV Card, FAA email, eLMS, etc...should be set-up at the Academy. We waste so much time at the facility level setting everything up. It can take up to one week when the trainee could be training."
468,Great instructors.
469,"This course is massive. It should be broken down into subsections to include TRACON, ARTCC, and SME. The SME course should include the other courses as pre-requisites and then build on those concepts in greater detail and comprehension. The TRACON and ARTCC courses should go into d"
470,"Instructors were very good, no issues..."
471,The instructors were efficient and informative. Their method of teaching is excellent.
472,"I wish the training was more focused on how the ATO/ATC specifically develops/applies lessons, rather than a general overview of the theories. I understand that the course is a ""one-size fits all"" approach, but I feel better tailoring would be beneficial. Especially in my particula"
473,"Excellent coverage of functions required for Departure use of Targets. Additional coverage of how to add new airports, new runways, etc was added in the extra available time and should be added to ciriculum. FPTs definitely will use this feature and AJV-5 specialist may have need f"
474,This course strongly reinforced my understanding of TARGETS which I use on a daily basis
475,"Lead instructor was very effective. Other instructors, as mentioned above, seemed not near as thorough but were otherwise generally helpful and very courteous"
476,Excellent Course
477,"Overall the course is good, unfortunately for me this is the 3rd time I have been in a (Guiney Pig) class. I think since this class has been reduced by 24 hours more emphasis needs to be placed on how the system really works, I would like to see a little more time spent on how and"
478,ETPR Training would be nice if it is added to the course.
479,class was overfilled- learning environment was less than optimal with a completely full class. Do NOT book each class to capacity.
480,"Both instructors were knowledgeable and full of energy. Michelle was over-the-top at times. Sometimes it felt a little bit like the Michelle Show. Otherwise, well-paced, energetic, and fun! Thanks for the effort that was put in to make the material memorable."
481,"Sam and Ken were great! Personable, knowledgeable, kept on track."
482,It gave me a great understanding of the OEAAA process and will help me perform my job from a point of knowledge at my facility.
483,"This course is for POI positions, not for 142 inspectors"
484,Great instructors-very informative and knowledgeable!!
485,Richard Payton did an outstanding job delivering the material in a way that showed its practical application.
486,"The lead instructor (Kent) was highly knowledgeable on the subject matter presented in ATBasics. He presented the material in an easy, interactive and understandable manner. I believe the class excelled due to his guidance throughout ATBasics."
487,Both were very good and knowledgeable.
488,"For coming into this class, not knowing the exact process for certain things, I have learned a lot. It made me understand more why I have done things the way I need to in order to get the job complete."
489,I feel that a day of com change practice would have been helpful before starting the non-radar practice scenarios. Many people learned the map along with the frequencies in a pattern. It would be helpful to emphasize learning com changes by looking at the previous and next fix on t
490,Roy Harris was top notch in every aspect throughout the course. Joe Stapleton provided some comic relief.
491,I would have liked the to learn more about the manager's options and considerations regarding Alternative Work Schedules and creating approving fulltime telework.
492,Additional information on travel and leave for both BUEs and non-BUEs with more specific scenarios.
493,"This is by far one of the best courses I have taken. The curriculum should include more air traffic functions. The lab should emphasize R-side/D-side use, manipulation, and comfort."
494,Great length for the audience
495,"Question 5 on this survey is hard to answer as the answers to choose from do not apply to the Question, i.e. ""Overall, how satisfied were you with this course?"" ""Agree"" or ""Disagree"" are not appropriate, should be ""Satisfied"", ""Unsatisfied"""
496,Jay and Gary were great. I could tell both of them had years of experience. They were very approachable and kept the class moving at a good pace.
497,It would Beneficial if tablets were utilized for the lab environment.
498,Instructors were very helpful with the class. Did a great job
499,Amazing!
500,the instructors have been great at working with me and assisting in any questions I had. the main problem I came across was that the row instructors and the lead instructors were not always on the same page. one row instructor would teach one concept after a problem and the next ti
501,"Recommend keeping AT Basics as an ""in-class with instructors"" course and not shifting to an online/CBI/self paced model."
502,George and Tim are great instructors...really got a lot out of this.
503,class could be shortened atleast by a week to do the same test on 5 different radios is over kill.
504,"Great Instructors, understanding the task at hand using the books words seems confusing - however the instructors cleared the fog of misunderstanding."
505,"More realistic troubleshooting scenarios that actually happen, not ""it can"" or ""what if's"""
506,Great Instructors - James Jansen and David Malloy
507,I think this course was very helpful in understanding the basics of Radar.
508,"Very good course, ASI's can benefit from knowing more about the MIDO and ACO's functions."
509,"The course overall was a great course. The content in each chapter reinforced what was learned in previous chapters and the labs were extremely helpful, at times more so than the lectures."
510,Could be a bit shorter
511,None
512,Very involved. Ensured everyone fully understood the objectives of the course.
513,"A bit more G-1000 training and exposure. While the sim sessions were very good, at times the equipment was down."
514,Great overview course to start each student off their FAA careers. Initial Professionalism lessons were spot on and the benefits of networking with FAA members from Ops and the Air Carrier world are a great benefit to a GA AW ASI at the beginning of my career is a fantastic opportu
515,"Instructors were knowledgeable and helpful, but in a large room it was harder to hear without microphone if the voice was soft."
516,"Hayden, Bill and Ron are simply phenomenal instructors. They provided a wealth of information based on their experience. I was by far my favorite course. Great Job to all."
517,Course covers all the topics I need to perform my job.
518,Kenton Storey was great. He has a lot of passion and knowledge when it comes to teaching us.
519,"Our instructors were outstanding. All were knowledgeable with aviation and the FAA. It seems like the overwhelming majority of Basics instructors had terminal backgrounds so being able to get some more ""real world enroute"" experience would have been nice but otherwise, I have nothi"
520,"Both Tim and Rainer were very well informed, did well explaining material, and were very approachable with additional questions."
521,DOP should be included in EHOT program. Will reduce equipment downtime and tech availability back at the SSC.
522,"Fire Paul Martinez.Laura Clark (RPO who previously failed the enroute course) tried to provide ""Cheats and help materials"" to myself and multiple other students in my class.Instructor Rickie Ford was great! R-sides Richard and Lisa were amazing. RPO's and all CNI staff were outstan"
523,"Overall, it is amazing how much we can learn in such a short amount of time. It is a good course but a tough course."
524,Instructors were very good.
525,The instructors were very helpful and provided a good learning environment.
526,The instructors kept the class interested in the subject matter.
527,"Very good course with good material. The ""sim"" was about the only thing I really thought didn't need to be a part of the class."
528,Very organized and knowledgeable.
529,The instructors in the radar lab were extremely helpful and gave a lot of good techniques to help me through the course. I really enjoyed working with each instructor in the radar lab and gained vital information that I will continue to use throughout my career.
530,I don't know what I don't know. But I still feel very uncertain that I have adequate tools and support to do my job well. I've gotten virtually no training on the finance side -- how to develop a budget and track against it throughout the year. I've gotten no training on how to cre
531,There should be a string set of courses (minimum of 4-with LMR included) that managers are required to take before starting the position.
532,Rich and Jack were great instructors. I have nothing but the utmost respect and thanks for them. They made the class enjoyable and were able to instruct in such a way that we learned quite a bit about the subject.
533,I must say Rich and Jack did a good job very nice instructors just not very clear on some of the examples we went on in class like I said I felt I learned more from other substitute instructors than I ever did with my lead.I do have to say every time I had a a question or concerned
534,Again Outstanding!
535,"Cold not have asked for a better instructor, Glenn was extremely approachable, encouraging, and showed that he genuinely cared about the success of each of his students daily. He was the right person for the job. Thank you for having him as our instructor."
536,"Fantastic instructors, genuinely cared about the FAA Inspectors."
537,Karlie and Mike were both great teachers when we had them as well as entertaining to keep the material from being dry at times.
538,Ray was very ineffective as an instructor. He would rather tell stories from before we were born and get mad at us for not remembering them. He also would throw small fits when asked questions by the students. All other instructors were great and I fully appreciated everything they
539,great Leads in all classes.They all knew the material well
540,Instructors were very approachable and helpful
541,"During IACRA lesson, instructor moved a little quick, moving along with our computers, ours would not open to the next page as fast as the Instructors would and he wouldn't always state which page he advanced to leaving one a bit behind."
542,The instructors were very good and presenting the required material
543,Content is good. On the next course revision you might consider putting the names of each lesson on the lesson tabs. It would make it easier and quicker to look up items
544,Very helpful and patient.
545,It would be beneficial to be able to watch other classmates run problems. Being able to spend as much time practice our scan on the radar scope and seeing different techniques would better my success at the academy.
546,This course has taken a big step forward with still a little to do.
547,More training on high pressure chillers
548,"Tomas and Mark were both fantastic, and everyone in the class feels lucky to have them as instructors, because of their willingness to go above and beyond to help students."
549,"The only real problem with this course is the lack of time available, and the corresponding compression and curtailment of the material. A full program of training in the subject, rather than an abbreviated concepts course would provide leverage helping undermanned FSDOs where ther"
550,"I thought the pace, content, and instruction was perfect. The course length provided enough time to go through everything thoroughly, make sure everyone was on the same page, allowed for questions while at the same time not creating too much 'dead time' so that the faster students"
551,The instructor was very helpful and provided us a great insight into understanding aeronautical charts as well as NextGen. I would highly recommend this instructor to anyone.
552,"As stated above, with the instructor's knowledge and passion of the subjects presented, their effectiveness was extremely high. I thought I was knowledgeable on the DPE oversight process, however, I believe I picked up a huge amount of new and current material. Excellent course!!"
553,Had several different type of instructor and they each had their own way of teaching. Would have preferred to not have the instructors change so frequently. The one instructor who was with us through out the training was very helpful and his teaching ability was great.
554,"This course provided me with the opportunity to practice developing and leading a structural change. te Instructors were excellent, as well as the learning environment."
555,The instructors were very helpful.
556,I thought that Mike and Charlie were very good instructors. They are the perfect balance to each other. They also want the best for us and they want us to succeed.
557,All good.
558,Would like to see new .3C and .58a
559,"I would like to train on same system as I work on in the field. Not "" This is the same BUT"""
560,Need current materials / procedures added to the class. Videos used in the class were very old and outdated...
561,"Instructors were very knowledgeable, patient, and open to input. Overall were highly effective."
562,"Overall, the course was executed well. An extra week approximately of running non-radar problems (3-5 days) would have provided a better pace in building up the difficulty of the problems and developing a better proficiency. Also having the option of foot pedals for keying up the m"
563,Very well organized
564,very good
565,instructors were knowledgeable of the material presented
566,The course and content was relevant to my position and type of work I do. Very good course.
567,Course provided insight to departure procedures. Very enlightening
568,very good course
569,Excellent course start to finish. Instructors rocked it! Course is continually updated and current which is very nice change from previous courses I have attended.
570,Excellent relevant material; well organized; fun games!
571,Bob and Jeff were awesome. James Field from Flight Check was an outstanding addition to the class and provided incite and points of contact that have use for DME 415 as well as systems beyond the scope of this class.
572,Fred did a great job
573,"The overall course was very challenging. However, the instructors were very helpful with any question that I had asked."
574,I think it would have been helpful to spend less time on flight data and more time doing local. some of the problems were very distracting and frustrating to work (radar going out/nordo)
575,None
576,Very Good Instructors
577,Fantastic instructors.
578,"It would be extremely helpful to have some summary sheets. For example, a sheet with the formulas for each segment. Also some summary diagrams of each segment. There is so much information for a new guy - easy to get lost. Also, math problems are done without corresponding units. T"
579,"Not required but needed because the employee is required to install, tune-up and make the equipment ready Flight Check and ultimately commissioning or returning to service so this class was valuable to help him accomplish his assigned work."
580,The course needs more hands on tutorials that use current procedure types.
581,The course material is could be a lot better. looks like there is new material coming for upcoming classes. The TI 6191.2 and 6191.406 has a lot of errors in them. If you have to follow then they should be correct. The flow in them is not very good at all.
582,Jim and Jim Bob are very good instructors. You can tell they enjoy what they are doing because it shows in their ability to connect with each student and make sure each student is learning the material. Their overall goal is to make sure everyone understand what they are teaching.
583,The instructors for this coarse are awesome PAY THEM MORE!
584,It is very hard to get the OJT and Cert in a timely manner and re-instituting EHOT/DOP would be extremely beneficial.
585,the instructor did a great job.
586,The 2 instructors were very experienced with the LDRCL equipment.
587,This course should be a week or two longer to properly cover this system.
588,The course very well organized and well presented to students.
589,"My employee is currently an ASR-9 Instructor for the FAA Academy, AMA-414"
590,"This course is oddly paced, includes quite a few questionably relevant distractors, but should weed out some of the unqualified at the expense of a few who would probably pass given a more relevant evaluation/training schedule."
591,"The material provided was very organized and helpful. The labs were set up very nicely, and were very helpful. I liked having an instructor for every two students running problems. I felt I would feel much more prepared for non-radar evals given another week of problems."
592,"Roy was a great and knowledgeable instructor. He was able to answer any question asked of him promptly, even if it required leg work on his part to ask around. Joe was extremely supportive, taking time to interject about our learning daily and to be sure we were understanding the c"
593,"The course is very well designed to learn the material. The labs assist greatly in preforming the necessary tasks. Some of the RPOs were not familiar with call signs or airports. For example, calling A123 ""Army 123"""
594,Ken was the best instructor in my opinion. Even tho he's very by the book and monotone he was good at explaining things. I'd say the instructors should do less story telling and more teaching.
595,The course was very fast paced in a short period of time and therefore was very hard to actually retain information for the long term.
596,The strip marking guide could have been better for the radar section of the course.
597,Most instructors are knowledgeable of the subject but it would be helpful if we didn't switch instructors so frequently.
598,The instructors were very knowledgeable. I learned a lot of useful information. This course was very informative especially for someone not familiar with 135 operations.
599,Outstanding instructors - the best class I've had so far. It would be nice if there had been some coffee in the room - that's my only suggestion. Thanks!
600,They bring a wealth of experience to transition us into our new role as ASIs.
601,learning progression was on point.
602,The instructors were knowledgeable and experienced in the subject mater. I feel confident to bring back this learning experience.
603,"I have found no consistent list of classes I am required to take as a new manager. I've found two lists and they are different. I've asked my group manager and he said he didn't know. I've asked our own internal training department and they don't know either. In general, it seems a"
604,I enjoyed working with Ron and Pete. There were some learning curves but they were very helpful. The classroom learning was frustrating at times due to instructors getting off topic.
605,Training material was very dry and included a lot of unnecessary information. Instructors did a very good job of teaching the material in an entertaining and easy to understand manner. Some functionality did not exist in the STARS lab though most of the functions necessary to teach
606,Instructors were engaging and interesting.
607,"Troy, Greg, and Mike all did an outstanding job. This was a very pleasurable course."
608,"The course should be at least one week in length, there was too much material to cover in only two days."
609,Out of all the courses I've taken with the FAA so far this one has been the most relevant and taught me the most.
610,Excellent - all
611,Both instructors are extremely knowledgeable about OE and this was one of the best courses I've taken in the FAA. It will significantly help me in my position.
612,Before being hired by the FAA I came from a professional background. I did not find this training helpful in performing my job.
613,well put together
614,"I appreciate the new problems. I feel like having the harder problems give us a better shot at the eval. However, I wish we could have had a running start in to them. It would be like learning to swim by being put in a kiddie pool, then being thrown in the ocean an hour later. If s"
615,"Less basics, more radar D-side lab time. Less ""Academy only rules"", more real life rules. Tower students should only run 6 runs a day, it's unfair that they get more practice each day."
616,"Would have liked more practical discussion about topics POIs have faced in the field. A lot of the course was more theory based. This approach may be better suited for new hire ASIs, but POIs at this point should know how to interact with one another."
617,"The slide material could be improved. There were many instances of formulas progressing through slides that don't fully explain where the numbers are coming from. Also, for a ""basic"" course there are many acronyms that should be fully spelled out. Not just on the first slide where"
618,The instructors and the amount of them were really instrumental in any retained or understanding knowledge. The slides are sometimes incredibly unclear or leave off needed information. The instructors really spent a great deal of time making sure we understand and could interpret t
619,Awesome!
620,"As I mentioned earlier, some of the more rudimentary components like phraseology and the phonetic alphabet would seem more appropriate in block 1. Other than that, the course is paced well and presents the material in an easy to understand manner."
621,Excellent instructors
622,Rich Green and Rich Wiggins were great instructors they took time each and everyday of class to make sure each student understood what they were teaching. They worked hard everyday for our class to have the best understanding possible.
623,"Our instructors Rich Green and Rich Wigins are the best instructors in the academy, they are very professional and respectful. They cared the most about our training in which I really appreciate their efforts, especially their patients!"
624,Both Rich's were awesome and helpful
625,"Instructors were great. Some of the best. RVSM - instructor updated us based on recent final rule that came out, which was best."
626,Great Class. Good instruction.
627,"Enjoyed the course, very informative"
628,"Gary and Mac were the best instructors I could have asked for, and I appreciate their hard work. Gary was even sick, could barely speak without issue, and still tried to give us tips on how to succeed. He made me want to be the best controller I could. Thank you Gary!! Mac seems to"
629,very good
630,Ray was very knowledgeable and cared about teaching. He made sure that everyone understood the topics and answered any questions that we had. Brian was very easy going and was able to teach us a lot as well. Both instructors seemed to care about each and every person in the room an
631,"We had multiple back up instructors swap around which wasn't a huge issue, but one instructor named Ray was pretty difficult to learn from. It seemed like he wanted to show off his knowledge off arbitrary crashes, stories, etc. and cared less about actually teaching us what we need"
632,"Great, only thing I'd change is maybe lose the C&E lesson."
633,"Add more witness preparation training; Delete unnecessary personal ""war stories"" from instructors."
634,"Content was presented very well, could have broken down into smaller groups earlier. The smaller groups I felt presented fewer distractions."
635,The course was not appropriately paced and felt rushed.
636,Course was well presented despite being the first class through for the new curriculum.
637,Thomas the BEST!
638,Work on a better schedule especially before evals.
639,"Very helpful course for arrivals. Departures I wish would simulate a departure rush for at least one problem with fewer built in conflicts, but a heavier traffic volume."
640,"The instructors were very could. They really knew their mathematics. My complements to them. I really liked when they put some of the mathematics on the board, VS just giving all the numbers orally. And what was really good, was when the did not explain it in a way that we understo"
641,The instructors (Michelle and Jill) had great energy and showed passion about what they do. The games and student interaction made the course fun and created a great learning environment. Thank you!!!!!!
642,Less pilot stuff and start tower and actual atc rules and sims sooner.
643,Great!
644,I think it is important to pay attention to the previous work experience and knowledge of instructors and what class of basics they are getting (En route vs. Terminal). I also was disappointed that we went the entire 5 weeks of basics without a lead instructor.
645,The instructors were very knowledgeable. Some of the instructors could be controlling but overall they were all great and I learned a lot from them. Thank you.
646,More sequencing of fast and slow aircraft.
647,Mr Allen and Mr Dodgen are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Both very valuable resources.
648,Good content overall. Some sections a little belabored but that may just be because I've seen all of this before in another career.
649,Audio problems took away from the overall effectiveness of the course.
650,great instructors!!
651,Course material was very good. The books I felt provide enough sample questions to help with learning the material.
652,"Personally, I felt many of the distractions in the class came when referencing Orders that were presented in the slideshow. A point was made to stop and have everyone pull up the applicable Order and read it from the source. While I understand the importance of accurate references,"
653,"All instructors,(Dale, Robert, and Stan), have a through knowledge of the course material. They answered all students' questions and concerns efficiently.They very well followed the core principle of teaching-learning process (pedagogy) in the correct way. In my experience for the"
654,"Instructors did a great job! Thoroughly enjoyed learning from Mr. Maloy! He is a great instructor, very approachable for questions, and an incredible resource. I wish I had this class years earlier. We should be offered this training in string. Many inspectors issue authorizations"
655,"Honestly, I can't answer these questions fairly, they are guesses. The employee was not here prior to class and she was a CTI, so I don't know where she obtained the most training. And since we haven't worked with her before it is no possible to know if the was beneficial. Based on"
656,"David, Matt and Jeff were excellent instructors are presented our scenarios in a very realistic manner. A. Rojas"
657,"Overall I feel the classroom portion was adequately paced for what we had to learn. The labs were helpful, except for some of the later lab problems. I understand that they are meant to help with working speed and remembering priorities, but at some point (It was problem 10, if I r"
658,"As a Flight Standards Inspector, this was one of the best classes I have taken."
659,Richard Payton did a fantastic job teaching this class
660,Good Course. James Field from flight check gave an excellent briefing.
661,Fred is hands down one of my favorite instructors of all time including my higher learning at the university level!
662,I think knowing the contact names for second level support is nice to have.
663,Need to add ADSS CERT into course.
664,The course was very well paced and had a very comprehensive coverage of the subject area.
665,I have fun and learned a lot during this course!! This course is a HUGE improvement over the old one I completed at OKC. Perhaps recommend reading the 8900.2B to students prior to attending the course and then do a quick overview of the 8900.2. Recommend a quick overview of what tr
666,"The course was great, although it could have been a little shorter as we had some free time."
667,"During training, I feel water distribution and associated components should be covered earlier in the training as it is the part that benefits all as some do not have the type of we are chillers being trained on."
668,Instructor Thomas is best instructor.
669,I felt the course was very effective and I learned a lot. I feel like I am going back to my center with more tools in my tool belt. Thank you very much it was a wonderful expierence.
670,none
671,Course was a little outdated in spots
672,They are good instructors.
673,It's good.
674,Future career path requirement
675,"I really enjoyed this course. I like how the written test was before we started troubleshooting the equipment, allowing us to focus more on the equipment then worrying about a test. Also, I enjoyed when Mr. Field stopped by and spoke to us about flight inspections and if we had que"
676,"Good course overall, however, since this course was designed to be taken after the TERPS Basics course, I felt like I was behind the power curve much of the time. Also, some of the slides we had access to were not the same slides used in the presentation of the course, particularly"
677,"They did a great job, highly informative"
678,Bill and Richards were both very knowledgeable and helpful. Could not have been any better.
679,"I think that the day one overload of information could have been given at the very end towards the review. Could have efficiently began with each section's lecture then lab. Then, discuss the entire system coupled with the review. Lastly, testing on knowledge retained."
680,"I felt the course was very helpful and prepared me adequately, though I do feel a bit more lab time would have been helpful."
681,"I feel more hands-on activities and labs would be a good thing, as well as more breaks. There isn't enough time to approach student services and travel with amount and lengths of breaks that we are given."
682,"The course brought together a outstanding group of experienced professional for this course. David, Jose, Jimmy and Glenn brought a high level of content and personal experience to this course. Their experience help the class to stay engaged. David Smith and Jose Salazar are phenom"
683,Highly informative class that will serve me well in my role with OE/AAA.
684,Instructors were really upbeat and very passionate. At times they were hard to understand due to volume or talking to fast.
685,Maybe more time spent talking in front of people (public speaking). This was and still is the hardest part of this and I know I am not the only one. Avoid it at most opportunities.
686,Fred knows the course information and criteria well. he did a great job
687,Reference question 9.
688,Excellent student materials. The building block approach used greatly enhanced the overall experience. Increasing course length to accommodate EHOT/DOP would be beneficial for SSCs with limited ability to use NAS equipment for OJT.
689,None
690,antenna maintenance as far as greasing. and hopefully incorporate ipads to follow along while training in lab.
691,The instructor new their stuff inside out and backwards. I have had Dave before and he is an awesome instructor and cares that you learn how to work on the system. His style of teaching keeps you relaxed. He also doesn't try to trick you on the wording of the questions on the test.
692,"All instructors very knowledgeable and professional. Norm Ellard is an extremely valuable asset, given his extensive experience. Course Manager, Ron Gendon's passion for safety and flight simulation excellence is inspiring. Well Done! Thank you all"
693,Having several instructors kept things lively.
694,Despite being such a large course the material was well organized and well presented. It also leveraged the advantages of having personnel from many different specialties and locations so that each of the students could learn from each other as well as from the material on the page
695,Excellent course
696,Eric Gandrud did a fantastic job keeping everything and everyone on track. He should be commended for his fine work
697,"When it comes time to start running scenarios in the lab, students should be able to watch other students run the practice problems. After the first group goes they should be able to watch the second group to see what changes or different techniques other students use. This will im"
698,I think the CKT 1 would be better placed right after the classroom work or move it up a week. Having it so close the NR evals I think distracts people from studing for the evals.
699,Great instructors.
700,"Very interesting course, learned a lot to work with my operators."
701,"Very effective, some of the most knowledgeable instructors that I have had.Excellent course."
702,"Mr. Currie is extremely knowledgeable and presented the course materials in a manner which was both highly informative and kept my attention focused on his presentation. He went the ""extra mile"" to ensure that each student understood what was just covered before moving on to the ne"
703,"This was a very good and relevant course, with knowledgeable instructors."
704,"Would like to have room computers for students so thy don't have to bring their own lap top.Would lie to spend more time on POA,s.Would like to have duel screens for instructors to facilitate showing information and references with out changing screens."
705,"Would like to Thank Jose Salazar, David Smith who were very helpful in assisting with the Course Studies and present real World situation as they had seen in their career."
706,The instructors did an excellent job teaching the course.
707,Fantastic course!
708,Exceptionally helpful and approachable.
709,TI have many errors in it. Becomes a issue when having to make decisions in the SOC environment.
710,The instructors were knowledgeable and helpful.
711,I feel disappointed going to evals that some more practice could be more helpful even.
712,"Roy and Joe were excellent instructors. While it may be a little difficult to understand Roy during the initial introduction of the material, once you learn it, he EXCELS at fine tuning your abilities. In the meantime, Joe can clarify your understanding to get you to where you need"
713,"Great course material, it just needs to be longer for more time to prepare POAs."
714,This course was exceptionally well executed. I enjoyed learning about how each chart is used and how all charts come together for pilots to use to keep everyone safe.
715,No he failed the course.
716,"Michael Baptiste in my opinion is a great instructor. He is very knowledgeable of the information, but most importantly presents it in a great way for students to learn. He is always willing to go more in depth on topics if requested, and is quick to let a student know if he is not"
717,Excellent course! I learned a great deal!!!
718,"Please stop referring to CEDAR replacing TRAX. This is still being developed and users need to know what to do TODAY! Add eLMS training to at least overview user management, supervisor assignments, and reports.Strongly encourage all training administrators to request eLMS administr"
719,The content provided in the course was excellent. The student guide has most of the information provided within the TI's as well as additional troubleshooting information that is not included within the TI. I would like to have Callie's course review power point as I think it conta
720,Would like an option of a paper copy of student guide to write notes in if the student prefers.
721,Abaris was terrific!!!
722,"Very good. Enjoyable to listen to and very knowledgeable. They both spoke well, were easy to understand, had good interpersonal skills. Highly recommend."
723,"Very knowledgeable, could use more videos if there is anything that can be pulled and used as examples."
724,RICH AND JACK ARE GREAT.
725,I would like to have an extra week put into the first phase of class to understand the material fully instead of just studying what is needed to pass.
726,I feel that it would be helpful to run a few practice scenarios in the lab that are similar to the sterile environment that occurs during evaluations. Also if a grade could be given on some of the evaluations so that students could have some empirical data to show their progress.
727,could be a little longer. I felt rushed in the class
728,very professional and effective on the f-420 system also helped me out with travel issues that I had from my office the instructors were very helpful in correcting my travel problems great work guys. it goes to show my office does not know what they are doing but the academy does..
729,the instructors were very Good. Jim Bob was very good at teaching the math part. he is able to present the material in such a way that I was able to understand it.
730,Bring back EHOT/DOP. EHOT/DOP took a burden off of the field. Now I will most likely have to travel more than 2 hours to find a tech in another SSC that can help with my OJT/PE.
731,"Each of my instructors were quite helpful. My lead instructor, Glen, was especially helpful in how lessons were taught."
732,great. good course.
733,"Thomas Lynch and Mark Sickle are excellent instructors. Although, the contract instructors used for individual non radar scenarios, are not. Most are irritable, rude and aggressive which does not support the learning environment whatsoever. Teach, do not yell at the student and exp"
734,I thoroughly enjoyed each instructor that I met. All provided me with valuable insight on different techniques to handle certain situations.
735,it's very good
736,The variety of the instruction was interesting.
737,great course
738,It was a good blend of lecture and lab time.
739,Instructors went at a pace to ensure material was being understood during lecture. During lab instructors would ask questions or give information to ensure everyone understood not just how to perform the tasks but what the task was accomplishing.
740,mehhh
741,the overall course was relative to my job.
742,Instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful. It was also very obvious that the Course Manager's attitude and intimidating leadership approach reflected the first few days on us all. We stayed after 1630 most days because the Course Manager would show up 5 minutes before class s
743,"Great course, so much to cover, could have been longer. Instructors were amazing."
744,"good course, which so much wasn't DVA's for the FPT's."
745,Ray was by far the most helpful as an instructor. He provided us with the course material and explained it to us in a way that was easy to take in.
746,Overall I feel as though most people involved genuinely want me to succeed but there just is not enough time to effectively process all the information given.
747,More running problems
748,"The overall content of the course is appropriate however more time needs to be taken with teaching the students to use the scope and read the scope. Less time can be taken on the computer message input training, there is an open lab for students to practice in and we spend so much"
749,Outstanding instruction from someone who actually cares that we learn it right!!! Richard Payton is extremely valuable to this organization and brings a wealth of knowledge and common sense to the course.
750,The course was a little basic for the level of experience in the class. Some of the lessons presented useful information but other lessons provided little value.
751,Very well paced. If any questions were asked they were promptly answered. Excellent material.
752,"Jim, Jim Bob, and Paul were all excellent instructors that posses a vast amount of knowledge."
753,Great instructors I thank them for their help and time
754,Very good course. I do think that the last day should have less detail when doing the exercises.
755,"Minimize instructor stories. Not ever scenario requires a drawn out personal example, certainly when one instructor already provided a scenario. It is hugely beneficial to have real-time examples, but not to an exhaustive length.These are critical critiques. The course and instruct"
756,"The instructors were very knowledgeable, friendly and did a great job."
757,"Recurrent courses for FAA inspectors should have additional simulator training days. One simulator (2 hours) is not enough for a pilot that does not fly the aircraft regularly (line pilot). Also, the provider should be required to use manufacturer procedures."
758,great course: something you will take home with and use at your office\work
759,"My instructors, Thomas Lynch and Mark Sickle, are very knowledgeable instructors and are helpful during class discussions.I was not satisfied with one of the scenario instructors, Wesley. He was very condescending towards me and I did not enjoy my learning experience that day."
760,The lead instructor helped prepare us from the start with all the knowledge needed to prepare us for evaluations and testing. He went above and beyond to explain all information and ensure total clarity when teaching us new concepts. The in class assistance greatly prepared me for
761,Very Interesting pair.
762,for the most part was taught pretty well I didn't like the fact that almost every day there were a different set of instructors I feel that if we had a particular set of instructors that the learning would have been a little more effective.
763,"Bill and Chuck were excellent instructors. I found them to be very knowledgeable and invested in my future as a radar controller. They were easy to approach and let you run the problem, only chiming in when needed. This fostered the most effective learning process, personally."
764,Execellent
765,"Much more useful information than previous trainings. Helpful that it was targeted towards engineers only, so that information was on topic and directed toward my job."
766,Instructor are really knowledgeable and helpful.
767,Great course
768,"Participant Guide: Too much ""white space"" that could have been cut down by (3) slides per pageI noted that there were numerous ""references"" to charts on the board,that were not readable in the Guide. I could have used the ""Five Steps for 135 Application"" chart for full view etc...e"
769,I loved the different styles of Bill and Phillip throughout the course. They each demonstrated the different techniques to use and its effectiveness. They each made the class very enjoyable while teaching the material. Very easy to communicate with and helpful while putting our pre
770,"The time allotted was minimal, but the course was well done. Instructor is excellent."
771,good but could have been more reinvent to the work of the FPT
772,"Course material came pretty fast but was explained well and the instructors didn't hesitate to stop and answer any questions we may have had. Would have liked to have seen a few more examples of the 22 KT, 44 KT, and fly backs."
773,As stated above the CBI should be scrapped and incorporated into the in house academy course
774,"For the RNAV portion, it would have been nice to have had the PBN course, but I was able to follow that section without. Happy I was able to get in the course, even if it would have been nice to have the other first."
775,This is a very valuable course for FLMs.
776,I thought the course was very applicable to my ASI duties and I should be able to apply what I learned here back at my office.
777,Very pleased that we received Kent as our lead basics instructor. He is very knowledgeable and truly cares about every student that walks through the door that has a good attitude and work ethic. During the 5 week course we had several different instructors of which Kent was by far
778,"Michael was a great instructor. Really knew how to properly explain things and taught the course well, as did Charles when he was here. Those are the only two that we had long enough for me to have an opinion about/care to comment on."
779,Excellent
780,Bill and Phil were excellent instructors who demonstrated strong mastery of the course material presented.
781,"Bill Horman is a superb instructor, professional, engaging, knowlegable and really wanting to make sure students get it. He makes it understandable.Richard Westbrook only taught the first block, but I feel he and Bill make a great team and share the same approach & values. Please r"
782,The instructors were very thorough and ensured the course materials were understood and applied properly. Very interesting class
783,Instructor is very knowledgeable
784,George and Tim very good instructors.
785,George Dunn and Tim Lett were excellent instructors!!!!!!!
786,"Second assessment, question 23. Course material stated that the inspection team lead has 30 calendar days to provide report to OMT lead. Question did not have that as an option, 60 calendar days was the answer in the knowledge test."
787,My instructors were cool. I loved the cecilism..lot of jokes..corny and funny. Overall good learning environment.
788,Excellent Course
789,I wish the scenarios to prepare for the evaluations were more difficult to prepare myself for the evaluations. My class was told in the beginning that we were going to get harder problems but this did not end up happening and we are still unsure why. I also wish we had more take-ho
790,"Row instructors would frequently try to teach things contrary to what the leads had taught, and contrary to what was in the course materials. Or, in some cases of situations not covered in course materials, they would insist on techniques not mandatory or contrary to what had been"
791,Course needs more lab time.
792,Piece of cake
793,I really enjoyed the course and training that came with the course
794,The instructors made this course successful for me. There were times that we had material that was confusing or exercises that didn't make sense and the instructors were able to work through them with us.
795,Id like to see some antenna set ups. Maybe some more alignments. And not in groups of three. Groups of three and not individual labs really make learning difficult. My training was 10x better ojt back at work.
796,I believe all instructors were very helpful and knowledgeable. Created an atmosphere for success.
797,Overall I felt like the academics portion needed to be at least a few days shorter to allow time for more scenarios. The original scenarios were very slow as to be expected. Being told that we were going to be the second class to run the new scenarios made a lot of us worried. Whil
798,"Great course, I learned a lot. Following along in my own copy of 14 CFR was very helpful to me. I noticed books at the front of them room. Would have been nice if there was an announcement that we could use them for the duration of the course, although they appear out of date."
799,"I thought this course was very difficult and I think if we had more time in non radar we would be able to have a more solid base established, which would lead to better understanding of the material, you can only do so much in 2 weeks of non radar scenarios and having a third week"
800,"Overall good course, like I said I believe we need more practice in order to make sure passing rates. Also, the break out room is a place to relax, release stress and unwind. Our stuff was put in lockers before the end of the day and the room was cleaned up for following class. Whe"
801,"The course was organized well, although some things seemed to be introduced too early or too late in the course."
802,Good instructors. Having around 10 instructors through basics is a little distracting.
803,"Mike Ortega was amazing and I like his teaching methods and styles, we get told we will have our main instructor the rest of the time and get switched twice more? Karlie is a wonderful instructor as well!"
804,Thomas Lynch is a top notch instructor and I feel very luck to have him as our lead. He deserves a raise. Dave is very friendly and motivational which is appreciated. Some lab instructors offer advise to solve situations before students have a chance to come up with their own or ma
805,Too much time focused on reading lesson plans in class. Should be given free time for reading and go over as Q&A class activity instead. ERAM LABS should be scripted first week to help student understand fundamental concepts. Rather they overloaded new concepts in early labs that c
806,it worked
807,The overall course was really hard and really tests your limits and will. Everything is given to you its up to you to apply it you can really get behind in this course the instructors will remind you every day of it. They don't give homework in this course which can be a down fall
808,"All the training I needed ended up being taught locally. I was hoping to take some good stuff away form this course. But in all honesty what we need as techs is going through the pm's and maintenance, as required and troubleshooting. The hours of theory that never stuck and was not"
809,Excellent instructors all the way around. Most transitions were smooth and the presentations had few hiccups. This speaks positive volumes about how they prepared for a first course offering.
810,Great job. Instructors were very knowledgeable.
811,Excellent Course. Very well presented.
812,The instructors had a wealth of knowledge and were very accommodating and were accessible for any questions.
813,"Really enjoyed the lab portions of the course. Some of the course material was pretty dry but for the most part was a really good review, and also taught me a lot of new things pertaining to the radar side of ATC."
814,Rich Green and Rich Wiggins were outstanding in their instruction and made a good team.
815,non radar
816,"All the instructors were knowledgeable, capable and competent. However, years of working around jet engines has left me with some hearing loss. Not being able to hear a soft spoken instructor kept me from getting the full benefit from the course."
817,Terrific instructors.
818,BRING BACK EHOT/DLP...don't kick the can down the road...maintain the high standard of certification by testing all to the same standard in OKC.
819,Great Instructors. I truly enjoyed the class.
820,all did a great job
821,Without exception...these instructors made this course an absolute pleasure and expanded my knowledge of the system.
822,Course material was very laid out and easy to follow and understand.
823,"I really NEEDED this course since having been selected to do proving runs within 2 weeks. Two weeks before course, I crewed a Falcon to London and back, and was clueless to the details of long over water.Dave Maloy was excellent, and really got everyone's attention.Tell him so. Reg"
824,Overall great experience. I would not recommend to instructors to have students read allowed the lesson plans to the class. It was hard to follow along and nobody in our class liked doing that. Thomas never made us do this but other instructors did.
825,"Overall content and course material is good. However, as I'm sure many of my classmates will agree, these new scenarios are tough. I understand we learned a lot and saw more things with the new scenarios than the old ones. I get that. But the new scenarios did not give the students"
826,"As far as the material goes, I felt it was very effective when paired with a good instructor. As far as the organization of the material, I felt that quite a few of the lesson plans were out of order, and can be organized better. Lastly, I think the time it takes to go through all"
827,"Most of these classes are good for foundation but 90% of the time you don't know and remember what you're taught because you may not ""touch"" the equipment much or for another year maybe.The school should consider giving refresher course (that would help with nastep inspections and"
828,I liked all the lab time.
829,"Despite the negativity from the main instructors at the start of the course, it was a good learning experience"
830,The course was informative and helped me find strengths and areas that need improvement.
831,The training complete.
832,Great course material and hands-on time with equipment
833,Great job with complicated subject.
834,"Fundamentals of documentation, specifically eTpr, SAL, Peabody."
835,"For the amount of content and material presented in the radar portion, there was little time to be able to go over and fully understand the material to a comfortable level. For academics that prepare a student for evaluations at the end of the course, it is a lot to take in in such"
836,He is in Training still and has not had a chance to Supervise employees yet.
837,very good overall. Would have liked a little more test prep.
838,Labs and troubleshooting set up in a manner that was extremely effective in reinforcing material that was covered during lecture.
839,"Rich and Rich were the most helpful and knowledgeable instructors I could ever ask for. Also, all the instructors in the Radar lab were excellent."
840,"This course was a real ""eye-opener"" for understanding the performance level required by simulators and other FSDs."
841,The Instructors were phenomenal. The experience level and motivation was exceptional.
842,The instructors were all good and knowledgeable.
843,fairly fast paced course. instructors were knowledgeable.
844,GLEN IS A WONDERFUL INSTRUCTOR. HE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS THE INS AND OUTS OF ALL THE BASICS INFORMATION AND TAUGHT THE CLASS IN A COMFORTABLE AND INFORMATIVE MANNER
845,Roger Basterash and Samuel Colasanti were both exceptional.
846,"I learned how to protect a ""stick."""
847,Very well organized
848,"Troy, Mike, and Greg presented an excellent course that was probably one of the most valuable I have taken during indoc. The concept of SMS will be with the FAA for years to come and I find the subject highly interesting. At Mike's suggestion, I am hoping to come back and help teac"
849,"Well presented, was able to answer related questions to a slide and transition back to class content easily and was able to keep class on task."
850,Added. it would be nice if the entire TERPS development could be done by this software. right now we have to use 3 different software programs.
851,Good Class. Plenty of hands on equipment time.
852,Over all the instructions are good. The only thing I would say to be better is to have Sezzle to speak at a slower pase since he most of the time speaks at a very fast past making it difficult to understand.
853,"Great course, applicable to my job"
854,Instructors were great.
855,Very Good course
856,"The instructors I had were great with my group. They were very knowledgeable, and I liked that they allowed us to make our mistake and then allow us to either correct it ourselves, if we recognized it, or give us pointers, and not just talk us how to ""run the problem""."
857,Both Lead and Assistant Lead are very helpful and knowledgeable.
858,All instructors were very knowledgeable about the information.
859,The course was made very interesting by the quality of the instructors and their interactions with the class. I was very happy that I attended this classs.
860,Very knowledgeable
861,Carly should be the go to for Charts and pilot info - since she was a pilot she gave great inside info regarding this and helped make the charting lesson more bearable. Also she offered her own personal touch which in return helped me to understand the lessons better.
862,Kent is a very effective teacher. He knows what he's talking about and presents the material in a way that is easily understandable and applicable.
863,Great course
864,If people don't need to study; then they need to be quiet and not distracting or leave the room.
865,The course needs to be extended.
866,"Pretty much all arrival training at TSEW. When I got to my facility I train on departure and satellite first and will not do any arrival training for a year. Hopefully I can remember what I learned at TSEW. Its not really the Academy's problem, but maybe I should attend TSEW right"
867,Excellent.
868,"Reducing the course to a ""Principles"" only, increases the time for an inspector to become competent in this area. In light of the short staffing levels in AFS, it is difficult to have the OJT opportunities needed to qualify to Level 3. Having more time in a more capable course enab"
869,"My only negative interaction with an instructor was with Wesley Carter. Speaking with several other students I quickly realized that I was not alone. Several other students said that after working with him, they wanted to seriously reconsider their career choice. I felt as if his r"
870,"Roy got better as time went on, what was the point of having a second instructor when he was allowed to teach us anything, also not helpful!!!!!!!"
871,I thought the overall course was good. I think that there should be more labs so you are better prepared for eval day. I also think that there should be a better way to let the student know what they did wrong rather then just write it on the back of a paper.
872,Instructors were highly qualified and had great willingness to share their knowledge.
873,Well written.
874,"My seemingly negative responses to these questions are a result of already being exposed to these techniques and concepts, which really weren't specified in the course title or description. Renaming the course and providing a more realistic description will assist potential student"
875,David is an extremely knowledgeable and passionate teacher. He answered my questions on any topic that is related to this class. A very interesting class to take. I wish we can combine the Battery Class with this class.
876,I thought this course covered incredibly relevant material and I liked the use of the sim and writing just partial POAs for practice. I liked the interaction between the instructors and the students in all the various roles. The constant critiquing was tiring but I saw the need for
877,"Jill and Michelle emit some serious positive energy that is contagious in this course. I really enjoyed the course, games, ok and the candy helped."
878,Each instructor would teach you different ways to do the same situations and it was up to us to piece together how we would handle it. I think this was an effective way to handle the environment.
879,The instructors both did an excellent job with very complex and extensive material. We're very fortunate to have access to Tim and Rainer for this course. I'm sure Steve is good too.
880,"The facilitators did an excellent job getting the members, discussing their experience with the topics being covered in the work shop.. ""real world"""
881,All the instructors were very encouraging. I fell like they really want us to succeed.
882,Overall the course was great. It would've been nice to have more problems to practice similar to the pa.
883,"the course was ultimately effective an provided a great learning environment for me to excel. I am a visual learner so the only thing that I thought would have been cool would have been to actually go to a runway or look out from the tower at the runway, during that chapter and loo"
884,Overall I felt that the ATBasics course was well planned out and went at a very manageable pace.
885,"During the course we had several computer and software malfunctions, but the instructors and IT worked fast to mitigate the impact."
886,Great Instructors
887,Ray was pretty good. I took delight in his teaching principles.
888,Instructors were very engaging and kept the class content interesting. Sam and Ken make a good team!
889,"Great staff, knowledgeable and energetic made each day a pleasure."
890,An excellent instructor. He was very knowledgeable and confident in his presentation. He made the class fun (if that's possible). He was also very willing to help on an individual basis.
891,Excellent instructors
892,"We have been in string for 8 weeks, no need to spend 1 hour and 10 minutes reviewing MMAC compound and building locations, we're familiar."
893,None. Was a good course
894,More opportunities to learn about dealing with unions.
895,None.
896,The Leads are more knowledgeable then the row instructors in general. You can tell when you get a row instructor who also has had a class recently as a Lead.
897,yep
898,materials organized
899,Add preventive maintenance.
900,Overall the course does what it needs to do!
901,Rich Green and Rich Wiggins were great instructors for nonradar. They always explained our questions to the fullest and tried their best to make sure everyone fully understood the material in the short amount of time we were given.
902,None.
903,Instructor for the course are awesome. Enjoyed the instructor as they kept the class engaged.
904,"More detail on how to handle problem employees, particularly ones that cannot or will not improve their performance to required levels."
905,The part-task was effective in showing how to apply radar concepts and rules. I think the course would benefit from having more part-task to demonstrate practical application of lessons learned in the books. Some individuals learn better from visual demonstration. Part-task is a gr
906,"Rob Mizell is a great instructor that made the course fun and easy to understand, some would say he is a legend. The lab instructors were patient and thoroughly helpful. Great Course!"
907,"Greg Carroll had an obvious bias against pilots. He played it off as humor, but it was clear he had a negative attitude he was merely masking. Furthermore, he was all but dismissive of general aviation. All the examples he was able to give were air carrier. This made it even more d"

909,Great Course
910,Both Callie definitely knew the RDVS forward and backwards. I'm convinced she could probably do PM's on the RDVS blindfolded. Not joking.Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the RDVS and was very good at guiding my thinking while I was troubleshooting. There were a couple of instan
911,"By far, this was the most informative course I have attended in the FAA."
912,This was a well structured class that gave me plenty of hands on with the equipment.
913,"Good program. removal of the DOP seems like a non-issue for me, as I must perform an abbreviated PE (site familiarity) when I get back from OKC anyway."
914,Very helpful
915,"Overall, the course could use some work. Row instructors should follow what our lead instructor is teaching us to promote consistency and good habits. They should also refrain from making the problem an even more stressful situation by remaining calm and understand we are learning."
916,"It would be advantageous if we were able to receive a ""practice"" graded scenario from actual evaluators prior to our 3 graded PV's. It sounds like there is a large discrepancy between lab instructor grading and evaluator grading. At this time I am not certain as I have not taken my"
917,"It is tough to gauge the course before we run the evaluations. If we all do well on evaluations, then I would have no complaints because the more difficult problems made us better prepared. However, I feel like some of the problems were more ineffective because of the amount of tra"
918,The instructors were overall very helpful and knowledgeable.
919,Not required and current position does not require task certification of any kind.
920,The instructors were amazing. Everyone was incredibly knowledgeable with the subject matter and course even though the course was brand new.
921,"effective instruction, great instructors."
922,dual monitors would be a great addition for the students
923,The instructors were absolutely terrific!
924,A section of SA Cat 1 and Cat 2 ILS' would be nice.
925,More tools functionality overviews. More approach/terminal functions
926,None
927,learning STARS entries would be very beneficial
928,Very beneficial and was a good overview into the ATC system. The pace was good and it was easy to remember specific topics and pertinent information from week to week.
929,Employee is no longer with the FAA.
930,I feel that the Lead and A Lead instructors were extremely helpful throughout the course.
931,Jeff Phillips is very knowledgeable and a great lead instructor to have for radar. Dave Cockrell was also really helpful and I had no problems asking him any questions. Both definitely helped me understand how to work radar problems.
932,Add a little depth to charting and how the charting information is put together and how detailed a map is inspected.
933,No changes are needed for the course
934,Instructors were very knowledgeable and approachable. Both Pam and Lloyd made the class enjoyable.
935,Rich was very involved with the class and was willing to help anyone with questions. It was very clear he had an investment in our learning. He wanted all of us to succeed. Jack as well was very willing to help. After learning this was his first class he was apart of it was underst
936,Great instructors.
937,Great instructors.
938,The aircraft portion of this course was removed. It is worthwhile keeping the flight aspect as this is a major aspect of our job.
939,very knowledgeable.
940,Roger and Samuel brought years of experience to the classroom. They answered questions directly and with explanations. I enjoyed this opportunity to learn Part 21 which I can apply immediately to my daily work in the Boston ACO.Thanks for the training!
941,"Good course, a little dry by nature. I would say that the first 4.5 hour, 24 question exercise regarding the design was painful. It was frustrating as it required me to find negatives. I wasn't sure if I had missed anything. It was ineffective due to the frustration level involved."
942,All were very engaging.
943,Very Helpful
944,"More practical application of information. examples of actually working in the field on certificate holders, more mock site work."
945,Steve and Nik did a great job with the class. I feel like I learned from this class which does not thanks to the instruction received.
946,More helicopter operations
947,Overall I felt the course could be geared towards what we will be learning in the En Route portion of the academy. Examples of rules that apply later on would be easier to understand if they used in relation to Aero Center instead real world examples found in the text.
948,"Jim Spurlin was a very knowledgeable instructor, he could really figure out a way to get the messages across to everyone."
949,Outstanding instructors. Great job encouraging and addressing questions!
950,Course needs to be longer because of the need to completely understand the items taught should be spaced out for easier understanding.
951,See comments above
952,Charles Heck and Justin Fontenberry gave the course a new positive level of experience that was very helpful with the material presented.
953,This course provided much needed exposure to the capabilities of TARGETS.
954,Michelle's teaching style was great! Make her the Academy director and get the rest of the classes cleaned up. In other words...Closed Sat
955,The practice problems and examples helped. Sometimes going over terms and new concepts with classmate or seat partner were more beneficial.
956,"I felt that the content of the material was very good and conducive to learning the material; however, I feel that the order in which the material was presented could use some tweaking. What I mean by that is that the instructor had to slow down or stop several times just to explai"
957,The group discussions and interactions with the other students were one of the most helpful tools. The self assessment in speaking is something I can take with me and a tool I will continue to practice for improving my speaking skills.
958,The course was broken down in basic chunks that made it easier to digest and understand.
959,"It would have been great to take work home to study overnight to prepare for the next class, but I understand the reasoning."
960,I think it was a great course. I wish the book was a little more applicable than the course study.
961,"For the most part instructors were effective, there did seem to be slight differences in the interpretation of the loa's, sop, etc. An example being in trail spacing for overflights and departures versus successive departures seemed to cause mixed answers. But overall lab instructo"
962,The instructors were very knowledgeable and I found their personal examples to be very helpful in understanding some of the course material.
963,The overall content of the course helped me to understand more effectively on how to use the OE/ AAA system. This is a must in my position and for I use it daily. Richard and Tom made it easy to understand which will in turn increase my proficiency in my office.
964,rich walker and jack sudatis were extremely helpful and approachable.
965,"Bob Enoch, Larry Ross and Ian Spaude we very good instructors Thank YOu"
966,Very good class for class room instrution.

968,Charlie and Mike are great instructors and make an effective team. I wish we had them from day 1 instead of switching instructors from nonradar to radar. I think as a lead Charlie is very knowledgeable and has some great best practices however I do wish we spent more time chalk tal
969,"Amazing instructors, very knowledgeable, thank you for allowing me to attend."
970,"I thought the course was put together very well, was relevant to our work in Airport Mapping, and gave a great overview of how our very specific jobs play into the operation of the National Airspace System currently and where things are moving in the future. The course was well bal"
971,Both Instructor Greg and Hakim (I am sorry if I misspelled their names) did an excellent job with the presentation.
972,Both Instructors were instrumental in my passing this course and showed genuine concern for learning the material to be used in real world applications. There help and compassion was greatly appreciating!!
973,The instructors were extremely competent and knowledgeable. They were approachable and helpful.
974,Both instructors did an awesome job explaining everything to us and teaching us the material to the best they can since everything was to short to truly have a grasp of Non-Radar
975,Rich Green and Rich Wiggins were excellent instructors and it was always obvious that they strive to have us understand and properly use all of the tools and concepts in non-radar. Many of the row instructors were also very knowledgeable and helpful in explaining when and how to re
976,The course content was interesting and appropriate. I enjoyed my time in this course and our course lead was very knowledgeable. It was helpful having a course lead that has a background as both a pilot and lifelong ATC specialist. Kent presented the material in an easy to understa
977,"It was a little difficult having a rotating door of instructors, but overall all of them were excellent."
978,"The overall course was a lot of information,"
979,"As noted above, all instructors were highly effective with the exception of Mr. Carter.Our leads, Thomas Lynch and Mark Sickle, were extremely helpful and motivating. Rich Walker was also extremely helpful when he filled in for Mr. Sickle during the first few days of non-radar.One"
980,"Thomas is the best instructor I've had. He was so polite, resourceful and patient. He always positive and helpful to all. He presents the material perfectly and I glad I have him as my instructor. I only wish there was 18 of him so he could sit with all of us and run problems. Mark"
981,Most instructors did a fine job keeping the class engaged through utilization of pictures and group discussion.
982,Great easy to understand and great interaction
983,I recommend submitting the evaluation after 4 months to better assess how the training has benefited the employee. The employee said he was satisfied with the training and would recommend it to other. A worthwhile investment to my department.
984,"Matt Galica, Jeff Curl and Dave Yerley were excellent instructors. Apologies if I missed someone. The course content was also really interesting. This course was the highlight of all the strings instruction. I am still training and have not yet done any check rides."
985,Excellent team and good tools. very throughout presentation

991,Cecil was fantastic and advocated for his students accordingly. He was extremely knowledgeable and always presented the material so we could understand it. The SAIC instructors were also very helpful in their long duty days to help us along when we needed it in TSS. Mark Johnson we
992,Great instructors. Best in the business.
993,Great!
994,material seemed a little dry I know its basics but I feel as if some subjects could have been a little more in depth.
995,"Our instructor Ray was very knowledgeable in en route, terminal and pilot information and I feel that really helped with explaining things."
996,Charlie and Mike were both great instructors. They were very approachable. Some of the lab instructors were not consistent with the material. Ron and Dave were great lab instructors.
997,The only thing that I think that needs to change is that we need to be able to run more than 3 problems a day. 3 problems a day leaves way to much dead time. It seems like the R-Sides and Instructors are already going to be in the lab. 4 problems or even 5 would be more beneficial
998,Great!
999,he is now part of single cert.
1000,Instructors did a great job with the material provided.
1001,Richard and Tom were very informative and made the class enjoyable.
1002,"Class was great want to do more with them, would love to be able to do departures!"

1004,Very Good in all aspects
1005,Shorten or delete this course
1006,"Great instructors and very knowledgeable, the only negative thing I would have are the stories of personal experience became too frequent."
1007,very nice course. definitely helped me to understand my role as TA better.
1008,"The instructors were well qualified, respectful and if the didn't know the answers they knew where to find them.As a side note Mike Hakim was the best CFI I have ever met."
1009,Really enjoyed the troubleshooting sessions. Those were really helpful in tying everything together.
1010,The instructor knew his way around the subject (DC Bus) and he had superior training and communication skills. I'll take back a lot of new knowledge to help me in my job.
1011,All of the above were advantageous and organized well.
1012,"Thomas Lynch, wouldn't have made it this far without him.Dave also was very committed to our success, and worked very hard to help us"
1013,"One more week of non-radar practice scenarios. Condense basics course to make up time for the extra non-radar week.I think it would be better to have RPO's work all practice problems, including Evals, as some of my practice scenarios were negatively impacted by sub-standard remotes"
1014,"It seems like we get everything we need, though it would be helpful to have access to e-learning activities at home. I know they can't officially tell us that we must study and practice at home, but everyone knows that we have to in order to have the slightest chance of passing. It"
1015,Instructors were vey good and clear and engaging.

1017,Very relevant to my work.
1018,Excellent instruction. Instructors did a great job.
1019,Overall the class was informative and extremely helpful.
1020,Dave Most has been great about answering questions I've had since the training. I've contacted him multiple times and he's been extremely helpful.
1021,"This was an excellent course. The course was tailored to ""how do I do my job as an ASI overseeing DPE's"". The content was perfect. Very appropriate examples and scenarios of the subject area where presented. It would be great if the academy would authorize more remote sited courses"
1022,Jim was very good instructor. Very approachable and was looking to help. Dave was good instructor very effective at getting to understand the situation. Will was very good and sitting down students and making them realize was going and an effective way to handle things.
1023,"This was a fantastic course. For the amount of material covered, it is impressive how well it ended up coming together throughout the two weeks down here in OKC."
1024,"You could learn from each instructor that taught a lesson but some instructors were much better than others, so it was easier to retain the information that they taught. Maybe it could be made so 1 instructor teaches all lessons in the course."
1025,Good course. The Kindles are not very effective.
1026,"Mr. Storey was absolutely vital in my understanding of course material. Especially considering that I am ""off the street,"" he explained things in a manner that was easily relatable and not overwhelming. Understanding that he was our lead, I can see that there might be some sort of"
1027,the instructor was excellent. He presented the material in an understandable format and at a digestible pace. He got the class involved which enhanced understanding. He continually reinforced basic points.
1028,767 Differences Training should be added.
1029,The lesson provided a much better understanding of how the DVAs are being developed and what tools are being utilized. Thanks so much for the class!!!

1032,Excellent instructors. This is one of the best classes I've had as a manager.
1033,I have nothing to add to this. Overall I have no complaints.
1034,maybe remind students that bananas bring fruit flies so dispose of them outside of classroom trashcan that isn't covered.
1035,"Instructors are all very knowledgeable and helpful, they were very actively looking to have comments to keep material up to date as best they can."
1036,Course will be valuable for my current assignment
1037,Great course! Thank you. Packed full each day tell 4:30.. This could be a longer course.
1038,I do not use non-radar where I am at so that feels like a waste for me. Some of the radar lessons also seemed like a waste. We learned about radar vectoring and I am not using that right now. Some of the lessons seemed pointless.
1039,Great course; very relevant to job assignment and materials were up to date and excellent.
1040,Upon completing the course I could say that on behalf of my class we felt that we were being spoon feed when it came to running the scenarios. Especially as it got more challenging and it was not until the very end that the instructors backed off a bit but by then it was too late.
1041,"Mr. Bob Talmadge and Mr. Bill Reisen demonstrated a very thorough knowledge of topic beyond the scope of the course material. They did an outstanding job presenting the course, initiating discussions, and reviewing examples. Mr. Brian Khan, instructing the class on legal issues, mu"
1042,Both the instructors Phillip and Bill Young were very helpful in understanding all the objectives. They were great instructors and help out when needed. The projects were closely related to the projects.
1043,"Class was great want to do more with them, would love to be able to do departures!"
1044,The course was excellent. I really enjoyed it. It was nice having multiple instructors. It would help if the monitors were larger.
1045,Very informative. Enjoyed the class.
1046,All instructors made a great team in explaining all student questions.
1047,Closed sat
1048,"Phraseology guidebook was up-to-date, however, the instructors weren't used to the phraseology for coordinating runway crossings as ground control with the words ""Reference (departing, arriving, 2 mile final, left base) aircraft, cross runway (28L/R or 16) at (Echo, Bravo or Hotel)"
1049,In my opinion the phraseology would be more beneficial earlier on in the course material in order to make better sense with what goes in group form and what goes in singular form.
1050,Instructors are all great however the amount of instructors was excessive.
1051,all dozen instructors we had were great
1052,Ken and Mike G were great instructors!
1053,Because I went right back to OKC for the final set of String classes - then the holidays came around. I will be using it in the near future. Still a good class and still remember things.
1054,"Everything was good, instructors were extremely helpful and we very willing to teach. Besides having Megan during problems I feel that the course put me in the right direction to be a great air traffic controller"
1055,This is a new hire and has not applied the knowledge learned from the class.
1056,None
1057,Overall content and course organization was excellent.
1058,Good
1059,"Bob Renn, Jeff Snodgrass, and Lou Powell are awesome instructors. I have noticed a trend with all of the instructors under Al Streetman...they are far superior to the instructors that I experienced on the main campus. The instructors at this end appear happier, better prepared, mor"
1060,Rickie Ford Sr. was amazing.Kansas City Joe was also really really good.Lisa and Richard were the best R sides.
1061,Charlie Manbeck and Mike Smith make a great team. There is a gap between the instructors and evaluators that needs to be solved. Instructors should be able to definitely tell you how the evaluators will grade you.
1062,The some of new problems were not ready to run but we ran them anyway. The instructors sometimes had no clue what was going on in them. Radio calls need to be spaced out more in the problems. It got to the point in most problems we were 4 minutes behind on calls just because they c
1063,Six days of radar academics were too short. A day of radar vectoring should be replaced by a day of traffic search since a lot of us still have trouble seeing what's traffic and what isn't. Course should have more concrete ideas at this stage in training. How do you study for subje
1064,It would be nice if the phraseology guide showed more examples of Radar strip marking such as crossing out a FDR and replacing it with KVKS or KGWO. A glossary of valuable 7110 references and a 7110 for the classroom would be also be appreciated
1065,RICH WALKER AND JACK S. ARE GREAT INSTRUCTORS AND DID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ASSIST US IN TRAINING AND SEEING WE BECAME PROFICIENT IN WHAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR EVALUATIONS. WHEN LEAD OR INSTRUCTOR IS OUT FOR AN EXTENDED TIME HAVE PLAN IN PLACE AS TO NOT HAVE A DIFFERENT INSTRUCTOR A

1067,No comment.

1069,"Mike and Charles were great instructors. Ray gave too many stories and I didn't feel like I learned what I needed to from him. He would also say ""You guys know this"" and then skip a page in the book or an answer to a book question."
1070,They were very helpful and aproachable
1071,Well laid out. Could be longer.
1072,EFFECTIVE
1073,Instructors are knowledgeable in the subject area and were proficient at presenting the information in an approachable way and clarifying questions asked.
1074,In large group it was sometimes difficult to hear and understand the material. ie: when instructor was speaking at the opposite end of the large room.
1075,"Instructor Mike Hakim was very effective, knowledgeable, and professional. I felt that instructor Greg Carroll was un-professional, didn't represent the administration as expected and geared the course to 121 environment."
1076,"Excellent course, but the TPRs used in class need to be updated to the eTPR print outs that the techs will see in the field."
1077,The classroom environment was very open and conducive to asking questions and learning. The skills and capabilities of the instructors (lead and a-lead) made a huge impact. I feel well prepared thanks to them in particular and those in the radar lab as well.
1078,the biggest downfall with my experience here in the academy is that I feel like basics was too long for no reason and everything that was taught there pretty much is not applicable to the rest of the program. Also the new problems that were developed for non radar I do believe help
1079,"This course did not provide enough time to learn the materials needed to be proficient for the evaluations. The book provided was not a very helpful resource material. The academics portion could have been pushed back, while more lab work should be added in."
1080,Jeff and Dave were great instructors.
1081,MAC AND GARY WERE BOTH APPROACHABLE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

1091,Instructors were great. Very approachable and taught the class well.
1092,Demonstrating points on the equipment helps reinforce the material.
1093,"Thomas Lynch was a great instructor, he held us to a very high standard and taught/communicated exactly what was required to succeed in this course. Some notable radar lab instructors were, David Benidetto, Jerry (Houston Center), Tim Galo."
1094,"Mr. Maloy made a course that could have been very dry and intolerable, enjoyable and educational.Course content barely fit into the amount of time available. It seemed to make the instructors overstress break times, student sidebars, etc."
1095,Very effective in highlighting the important aspects related to our Terminal job functions and providing examples.
1096,"The instructors helped me perform better. They were there to critique my study habits, and enhanced them to a point in which I was learning the information at a more proficient pace"
1097,"perhaps fewer supers in the scenarios. having 4 supers in a scenario does not provide any additional knowledge, just creates a longer final for no reason."
1098,Course covered a large volume of information in too little time
1099,"I do honestly believe that I have the most knowledgable instructor at the academy but when we are running our problems in the radar lab they do not teach anything in between and we just sit in class unless if we ourselves come up with questions about potential problems, I believe t"
1100,"Gary was very helpful! Again, I appreciate the time and effort he spent on the class to make sure we understood what was being taught in the lessons/labs. Thank you!!"
1101,Instructors were knowledgeable and informative. Their methods of instructing were good.
1102,My only criticism of the class is the course material (slides an notes) would be much more useful and searchable in electronic form than the paper binders we received.
1103,Cecil was an exceptional instructor. His lessons were always highly thoughtful and thorough. He set the tone of the course from day one and I will never forget his leadership throughout my career whether I pass or not.
1104,The instructors were welcoming and professional.
1105,Delete or tone down line up and wait and wake turbulence. Add pilot errors and equipment training and flight data /STARS knowledge.
1106,Good class - really enjoyed
1107,Course was overall enhancing to the job duties. I was disappointed when coming to the academy and told to come to the instructors or managers with any issues and when issues came up they were not resolved immediately if at all. This makes others realize that going forward with issu
1108,"this course is a familiarization of the TARGETs program. As such, it is a good start for FPT employees. I feel a more robust course should be required as additional TERPs functions come on line in TARGETs."
1109,very organized and throughout course. well timed breaks and lots of interaction
1110,We got the new problems from 14-26. I think they prepared us much better for the evaluations than the old problems would have.
1111,None
1112,"I liked the course overall, I'm a better controller leaving here than when I arrived."
1113,Mr. Kennedy was a fine instructor! He did a nice job and was approachable and available all week. He treated us like professionals and I appreciate that.

1121,"Keep up the great work, loved that you had FICO in as part of the training, it was very informative."
1122,We should add more days on the course so that we learn to fill up TPR.
1123,"Very knowledgeable on the subject, admitted the few mistakes he had and promptly corrected errors. Very helpful and insured everyone was on the same page within a reasonable time before continuing."
1124,This was a large class and the experience and background of the people in the class varied a lot. I thought the Instructor did a really good job working with that as well as going back and recapping/reviewing and explaining things that some where not understanding.

1138,Great Instructors!
1139,"I have no complaints, this course was properly paced and loaded with knowledge on the system."

1144,"Very effective, accessible, and user-friendly!"
1145,The instructors were excellent and did a fabulous job.
1146,I would have liked a better understanding of materials to bring and adapt. I would have liked a class roster provided sometime during the course. Student Services was helpful. Excellent course.
1147,"All of the instructors were great to work with. They made this class very informative, as well as enjoyable. This was a wonderful learning experience that we will actually be able to apply our work back at the FSDO."
1148,every ASI should have this course

1151,"I enjoyed this course, I came in with zero knowledge of Air Traffic Control and felt I have learned a large amount."
1152,"I would definitely take more time in learning the course, I did not like doing non radar but I still would nor mind doing it longer and learning more instead of feeling really nervous and unprepared for eval's."
1153,Very effective able to retain most of the information that was taught and thank them for taking there time for teaching us.

1163,Maybe put strip marking a little sooner so we are better prepared for when we go to phase 2
1164,NONE
1165,Instructors are very knowledgeable and make the material interesting to learn. Both Shon and Jim were very effective in minimizing distractions caused by strong personalities in the class. Very impressed.
1166,Instructors were great! Presented things that were in question from text into visuals that helped the class understand the subject better.
1167,Instructors were hands on with and willing to help anyone. They explained things in a way that everyone could more easily understand the material.
1168,Charlie and Mike are excellent instructors. They care about each student and have the passion to ensure everybody will pass.
1169,Both Dave and Jim were very effective in describing all the course elements and topics. I recommend this course for initial entry ASI's. Enjoyed the course and would like to come back again for a refresher in the future. Thank you.
1170,This was an excellent course. The material was complete and yet concise and extremely well organized. Reference material was very beneficial.

1175,Very knowledgeable
1176,This was a prerequisite for other training which I have not yet had.
1177,"The course was overall nicely presented. The course help me think of different ways to look at lesson, test and objectives. The only thing that I would like to add is maybe the course could be shorted to one week."
1178,The instructor was very knowledgeable and provided various explanations to the class if there was a misunderstanding to clarify.
1179,My level at this phase is lower than my peers. I was often left behind because of this. This has been a common theme for me. I learn the theory. Proving the theory is difficult with my skill level.
1180,Instructors were knowledgeable on the subject they were teaching.
1181,Use of OneNote and the tablets and lab equipment combined with the material organization fit my learning capabilities quite nicely. Excellent materials and learning tools
1182,It would be helpful to place students in this course according to their experience with the use of webopss. I would also like to attend again after I have used it for a year or so.

1184,Government spends a lot of money to train students just to have 2 local runs and 2 ground runs to evaluate your performance. I was prior experience in both tower and radar going into this. There were a few students that failed that definitely would have made great assets to the FAA
1185,"Instructors were very knowledgeable. Course manager made the class very hostile from day one, regarding the used of cell phone and observing the instructors. about day 3, instructors started to loosen up and feel more relax."
1186,Instructors were good with what they had to work with.
1187,The ROW instructors need to be more in line with the course instructors on how to teach things and what is the correct way vs what isn't the correct way.
1188,"I learned quite a bit in the Basics course, especially for being an off the street hire. It was overwhelming at times, but I have great instructors and classmates that have helped me along the way."
1189,"There were students at all levels of the spectrum in terms of experience in the class. At times the teachers taught to the higher experience level, which left the beginners in the dust. Please avoid this in the future."
1190,None.
1191,"I wish that I had tabbed my LMR order as we were going through it the first time so that I could quickly cross reference it through the class. I found myself thinking ""where was that"" many times. Might through in a mention to tab these as the class goes though it on the first round"
1192,"As mentioned in added training, I believe the course should be longer. I would also like to compliment the instructor. Michael Currie has excellent knowledge of the program and great delivery. Thank you!"
1193,"The course, overall, was very informative. I can take back a basic understanding of radar to my facility."
1194,This was an excellent course. Thank you!
1195,Good Course
1196,Overall great course.
1197,I am currently an ATM on temporary assignment. I do have a need as an FLM to use this software for Article 48 assignments as a Metroplex lead manager.
1198,"I feel the professionalism course has been an asset to my current job position and should continue for AFS employees. Many people bring great technical skills to AFS, but lack organization, speaking to include listening, and teamwork skills which are all part of the professionalism"
1199,This course is not long enough to fully cover this system. The FAA has no formal or structured OJT program for technicians that return to their work centers for further training following academy courses. If the course doesn't cover something it isn't likely that a technician will
1200,excellent instruction - Instructor pair was diverse enough to provide alternate views of material. Instructors were attentive and appeared genuinely interested in student progress.
1201,"Great class, the instructors are very knowledgeable in the subject matter. One of the best classes I have taken at the academy. Its refreshing when you ask a question and the instructor not only can answer the question but expands on it giving you more than what you expected for an"
1202,As previously stated 2 weeks in the Radar Lab out of 4 months in OKC is ridiculous! Evaluating someone's performance on Radar Application when they spend a total of 12.5 percent of their time actually in the radar lab seems like a very poor idea.
1203,Some of the updated/later nonradar problems/scenarios were paced so high that it felt like I was not grasping the concepts because of just trying to keep up with the pace. In fact it hurt my knowledge of the concepts and rules I did know since it was so rushed. Most of new problems
1204,The Instructors did their best to answer our question and were helpful along the way.
1205,I feel the three ring binders should be replaced with a digital program guide. All of the links and reference material would be MUCH more useful and searchable in an electronic format.
1206,Thomas Lynch was very knowledgeable of course material and explained things in a way to help everyone understand. If anyone didn't understand material he would do whatever it took to get everyone on the same page. He kept everyone motivated and eager to learn so that we would push
1207,material was good we should get more practice on the radars must say I feel more prepare for evals than non radar.
1208,"Mac and Gary both know their stuff. I feel our class struggled with consistency because Mac was sick a lot and Gary was gone for a week. I overall think that is a good thing, being able to hear from different instructors on a weekly sometimes daily basis I think helped the in class"
1209,Mike did a great job!! as always!
1210,Instructor Bill Guinan was outstanding.
1211,The instructors were some of the best at the academy. They did an outstanding job of making the best of a bad situation. See comment 1 for a description of the bad situation.
1212,"relevant, knowledgable"
1213,The instructors were great they complemented each other very well and had great experiences to relate the course too.
1214,The simfinity part was really helpful for understanding what to watch for in the cockpit.
1215,"In regards to the row instructors that are present during the nonradar practice scenarios, there seems to be a vast difference not only in teaching styles and preferences, but also in the actual material that is presented to students. It is useful to learn the same information in d"
1216,The two instructor for our class were outstanding. They did a great job with the course materials and allowed for discussion when needed.
1217,"The course layout was logical, interesting and up-to-date with the latest rules and regulations. Materials, illustrations, examples and class exercises illustrated difficult concepts and thorough."
1218,This training should be required with 6 months of becoming a Frontline Manager
1219,the course could use a better overview on the working relationships with all the charting offices.
1220,"Roy and Joe have been great instructors overall. Roy likes to jump ahead often when teaching academics. This can be very confusing at times, however, looking back I can see how it can help. If there was a way he could be more clear about the parts he's jumping ahead on it would hel"
1221,I am going into evals tomorrow with a low chance of getting a score higher than 50. Given more time and the opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge my instructors possess most likely would help the student progress in this course with confidence and allow him/her to succeed.
1222,I really enjoyed our lead instructor Ken Cheers. He provided many examples from his personal experiences that helped me learn certain concepts that I would not have gotten if I had just read words in the book. He is a great instructor and I wish that we had not had to swap instruct
1223,Rich and Rich were awesome they are a great team and work well together.
1224,Some instructors had better methods in teaching the material. Some of the instructors went through the material way to quickly.
1225,"Course was put together pretty well, while some of the material in Block 5 should have been put more together with block 2-3"
1226,"One of the best courses. PE's were mostly really good. PE usually were some of the best of string so far. The 91 exercises sometimes were too restrictive and not provide enough information to adequately benefit from the questions. Too many mechanics know the aircraft/manuals, and i"
1227,Jose and Richard are the best instructors!!
1228,Very effective
1229,"Although the instructors were knowledgeable I found that following the material was very difficult and some of the explanations inadequate. Knowing the material is one thing, being able to facilitate that knowledge is another."
1230,Kent Storey was an outstanding lead instructor. He made sure everyone understood the material to the best of their ability before moving on and paced the class very well. Some of the other instructors did not have that ability and would simply read what is in the book.
1231,"Fred was an exceptional instructor. I watched him watch students to look for learning and comprehension. He asked questions, making sure that everyone was following. Exceptional."
1232,"Communications equipment training. Also, more focus on antennas and transmission lines would greatly benefit the course as these subjects are present in all disciplines."
1233,GREAT INSTRUCTORS
1234,Both Instructors were engaged and enthusiastic about the course and did a good job of delivering the class materials. Excellent course!
1235,"I learned a lot from the Instructor's examples, analogy, real-life examples. Both Mr. Carrol and Mr. Hakim did an excellent job. Time well spent. Thank you."
1236,There needs to be more part 91 tasks included in the training.
1237,More theroy into how the system works. First big picture and then how the systems work.
1238,EHOT/DOP is a must. OJT/PE creates excessive burden on the field
1239,"Fred very high energy, always kept attention of class. Great job."
1240,"I am grateful for the opportunity this training present for Administrative Officers to learn what a manager should be thinking/considering when making decisions such as when to approve leave, prioritize workload, or make decisions about policy within the office."
1241,the class was to short
1242,Really a great class...too bad there's not an advanced class or CBTs to further explore the system.
1243,It was awesome to have the subject matter experts teaching the class!
1244,Instructor Dave was very knowledgeable and helpful after things settled down towards the end of the week with the tension. It was obvious the Course Managers leadership skills (which were none. It was a very micro managing environment) affective the environment.
1245,"The presenter was well organized, very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and very patient."
1246,The course has great material and is well paced
1247,See above
1248,Very effective
1249,"David, Shannon, Mark and Art are terrific instructors. Very nicely done to all. I enjoyed my time and learning experience."
1250,"The course had a lot of material. It was a good course, but many times the material assumed the student would know certain things or abbreviations. Well the mathematics is extremely important, I would have liked to see more on WHY WE DO THIS? It helps to understand the concepts bet"
1251,Overall course was fine - I wish RNAV Departures was presented as I understand they are approved for TARGETS software
1252,"We had a many instructors while we were here. It would have been beneficial to have one main instructor, preferably a former Air Traffic Controller."
1253,"Outstanding course, instructors, and training material. This course, and others like it should be mandatory for ALL managers and completed within 2-3 years of becoming a manager. The information presented during this course is extremely helpful/valuable to managers understanding an"
1254,"My lead instructors, John and Doug, were excellent. I thought they worked very well together."
1255,"Kent Storey was the instructor and he was the greatest instructor I have ever had in my life, I just think there were a few times when he could have went into more detail about certain things like I said before, other than that he was the best."
1256,Course was very well organized and for the most part presented information in a clear and understandable manor.
1257,Due to Stop of all training in the Empire area at SOCAL TRACON. Jared has been unable to continue training.Hopefully we will have a class and ramp up training to the area by July.
1258,"good class.Microwave was removed last string and still hasn't been fixed! There is only one. Need two. Also, the ice machine is broken. It broke yesterday (10/31/2016)"
1259,None
1260,"All three instructors were fabulous, knowledgeable and caring individuals."
1261,"The contractor would routinely interrupt the lab exercises/troubleshooting indicating the student was not performing a procedure correctly even though the student was not on the particular step of the procedure to which the contractor was referring. Additionally, the contractor wou"
1262,Thomas and Dave are outstanding leads to this course. They are always willing to help with any problem for as long as it takes until you understand the material. Scott has really influenced my understanding of the material at the academy. I was given the opportunity to work with hi
1263,Good
1264,Please add a hand-out that includes a template or outline for FSDO Admin DPE trianing
1265,"I was expecting the Initial Professionalism course to be more of the ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" and ethics of doing the job. The course all about communications, which I agree is very important. However, I feel the course should have been a mix of what we got with scenarios relating to et"
1266,Great instructors
1267,Fred did a good job with this course. It is a difficult course and he has a great attitude for teaching.
1268,"G was a super nice guy and would talk to us at lunch. They were as effective as they had to be. I think I'll pass the class. They sort of just read from the book half the time, but I would expect nothing less. Overall I wasn't over impressed, but I felt like I learned a decent amou"
1269,"The impact the instructor has is exceptionally important. As a CTI, I saw first hand how it can be rather difficult learning relatively new material coming off the street. Each week we had different instructors, so there was always a little transition between each. At the end of th"
1270,"The overall course was seemingly effective, but an extra week or two with slightly adjusted pace may have allowed a better result."
1271,"Our primary instructor, Kent, did an excellent job in relaying the material and answering questions that we have had. He was always sure to relate the material in the class to ways that we could relate to it with on the job experience. He gives the impression that he genuinely care"
1272,Would be nice to have more time to practice radar scenarios. Lots of down time and a very short amount of time to become proficient in a new skill.
1273,With the non-radar portion of the course we were able to practice scenarios at home. However with the radar portion there is really no way to better yourself outside of class aside from just reading the SOPs. A lab where scenarios could be ran could be extremely helpful with increa
1274,"Jeff and Dave were knowledgeable, approachable and helpful. Labs were helpful in the learning experience. Lab instructors had some conflicting knowledge regarding SOP's and were somewhat helpful. Others were not very helpful and impatient."
1275,"Some of the row instr need to learn the SOPs. In the lab sometimes I was marked off because the row instr didn't know the SOPs. It was also borther some when the instr didn't like how I set up EDST. They complained how I sorted and used the GPD, and if the row instr knew the SOPs t"
1276,Mack and Gary were both excellent instructors. They did everything they could to help prepare us for the evaluations.
1277,"The course had a reasonable pace. I suggest feedback to the instructors be one of, don't begin a lesson setting any tones that it is long, dry etc. That sets the whole experience up for failure. Instead, focus on how the lesson is critical to the success of managers, and I wouldn't"
1278,I would have preferred to start phraseology in an earlier block.
1279,"What an amazing team! Bill, Haydn and Ron work extremely well together. Their experience and stories are the best."
1280,"The training given by instructors were synonymous with the expectations for our own presentations. It was the most effective and organized training course I've received in any line of work. I will never look at another training class the same way. Also, I'm very glad I took this co"
1281,Great course.
1282,Effective and Modern course. Is directly related to the work we do.
1283,Instructors WERE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS SYSTEM
1284,"The three instructors: Randy, Kurt Dorian were excellent in presenting the material at a pace that everyone in the class understood before moving on, this was one of the better instructional courses that I have been to. A great job by the trio!"
1285,The instruction I received really helped me see the problems I was having. Some instructors would stop the clock to explain something if we didn't quite understand the scenario. That really helped getting live feedback of what I was doing wrong. Instead of later after the scenario
1286,"Overall, the course ran by too quickly. It wasn't appropriately paced in my opinion, especially when class 96957 had a snow storm come through and ended up pushing our scenarios together in such a small amount of time. The understanding of using radar lab equipment was pretty well"
1287,Both instructors were very knowledgeable on the system and were very open to questions.
1288,Both instructors were excellent
1289,Awesome class
1290,excellent instruction
1291,The exercises were great. It was a good illustration of how all the individual pieces fit together to help the pilot navigate. I wanted a worksheet I could take home to try to understand the end user better. The wide variety of backgrounds and years of experience my classmates had
1292,Add QMS forms and demonstrate the benefits of using all of the internal QMS Forms.
1293,Teachers need to ensure that the instructions for burning the info onto CD is clear. My attempt was unsuccessful and didn't notice till I got back to office.
1294,George Gunn was an outstanding instructor.
1295,"I feel that the training content, time allowed and format of this training are all pretty good."
1296,The instructors were by far the best part about this class. They made the material understandable and relatable.
1297,none
1298,"The instructors were the best part of the course. They brought together their own knowledge, experience, and expertise to the table and transferred it to us in an easy to understand method. Their humor made it relatable and attractive. Without them I don't believe my attention woul"
1299,Instructors where great with the course info as well as information about the OKC area.
1300,Thanks for the training. Had some problems with the equipment that put us behind. But overall we were still able to do plenty of TS.
1301,"Thomas, Mark, and Dave have been extremely helpful and knowledgeable of all subject matter.Thanks."
1302,"Need more difficult problems in labs to prepare for evaluations. More time as well, due to the high volume of information. Giving students pieces of what we might see on the eval, and having to cram it in our heads, may increase understanding of situations we might see on evals, bu"
1303,"Great class. Instructors were friendly, and enjoyed the class. Dislike the Dop being taking out. No complaints."
1304,Very good course. I really enjoyed the work related to the course.
1305,Very good. This course allowed more time for learning and the instructor was able to expand and answer more questions. Instructor was very good and effective.
1306,Instructors were very good at teaching at the level that I needed. They kept it so everyone understood before moving on which was also much appreciated!
1307,Good Course
1308,"Ensure everyone gets the ""word"" in time that there is a ""Pre Test before arriving.I managed to complete the pre training materials and it certainly helped !! Perhaps an ""Update"" course in a few years."
1309,"I feel that the instructors in the labs need to get on the same page as the instructor in the classroom. There is entirely too much diversity of beliefs for how things should be done, and we're constantly being told how to do things differently than what we were taught, or even tha"
1310,"It's paced a bit too fast for the amount of information presented, particularly for those without an ops or dispatch background. More simulator time would be good, too."
1311,Next Gen is becoming so prevalent and some requirements are only 3 years away I think this should be an InDoc requirement.
1312,"No issues with actual course, time constraints were an issue. The breaks were too short, and rushed. Add a day if necessary."
1313,Instructors very good.
1314,This is the best training the FAA offers for our FLMs. Nothing is more relevant than the course materials and networking opportunities that this workshop affords. The benefits of having these at the service centers where our operational supervisors can meet with service area suppor
1315,Some controllers were better than others.Ray was by far the best instructor--so knowledgeable and passionate about ATC and aviation. He gave us a lot of tips and explained things differently than other instructors. Ken Cheers and Mike G were also fantastic instructors and were able
1316,Instructor was very knowledgeable and able to teach very well.
1317,"I can only talk about how the TSS labs are outdated. For a better success rate I would make these computers more user friendly, helps with the nerves and hence help with the understanding on how to work the problem successfully."
1318,The pace of some professors were different than others in the way they approach the subject. Pam speaks really fast to get the content out but sometimes it is hard to understand her. There needs to be more examples or relatable items versus just reading the words on the paper.
1319,Having 15 different instructors made it hard to really have an impact. Mike O and Karli really made an impact and were effective. They are REALLY good!
1320,"It's either too long or too short...you don't get to the depth of anything and gloss over everything. Also, we aren't trained in the practical...like Castle approvals, and eLMS approvals, and Travel and budgeting approvals."
1321,The training talked about technical aspects of the physical radar equipment which I thought was ok but was not necessary for this course. It felt like an early course for tech ops maybe.
1322,Thomas Lynch was an amazing instructor. He explained all the concepts well and made every effort to ensure that we understood what was required from us.
1323,"All the instructors I have received feedback from seem to really know their stuff. It can be clear at times that they are here because of their wealth of experience in the field, which makes sense, but most of them don't have the patience of professional teachers. I'd imagine that"
1324,I felt like the course overall was well thought out and presented concepts in an understandable way. I did feel like a few of the beginning feeder/final problems could have fewer supers in them. Additionally I think the departure problems needed heavier jet traffic at least once.
1325,This is the best course that I have ever taken in the FAA. I had EXCELLENT instructors that did an incredible job. The only suggestion I might make is to adjust the course to run a maximum of five days with travel on Sunday and Saturday. Although the course was worth it I do not li
1326,Thought this was a good start to understanding basics stars functions and radar techniques and applications.
1327,material very well organized and presented.
1328,"I transferred from West Palm Beach and did need this training for my job while station there. Now that I have transferred to Tampa, I am working as a radar tech and do not need this training."
1329,I gained weight because the Donuts were delicious
1330,"Kent is a great instructor. He made the course material interesting and actually taught the material with a high level of personal knowledge and experience. I did not care for some of the sit in instructor, because I found that I had a higher level of material loss/misunderstanding"
1331,"Very pleased with Ray, Dan, and Brian. They all have a passion for ATC and Instruction and they care about whether or not the material is being received. I am very thankful for them."
1332,Had an overall positive experience with the course.
1333,I enjoyed the instructors willing to help in any way to make me understand.
1334,"they were both great. if any questions came up both instructors went above and beyond to get an answer, which is huge."
1335,"it was a great class, a lot of information was given."
1336,The instructors were very thorough and provided assistance in explaining the questions asked during the course delivery.
1337,Good material to support course instruction given.
1338,"All the instructors were very good., truly subject matter experts!"
1339,the lead instructors were very helpful in presenting the material in a way to understand it. its hard when row instructors give conflicting or wrong information.
1340,Course was great.
1341,Overall this was a good course even if the course was a last minute offering and slightly faster paced then I expected.
1342,put back EHOT/DLP. It is so hard to get equipment to train on in the field...get the training done at the academy!
1343,"Robert Flitter, Mike Vass, and Al Taylor are all very knowledgeable and helpful instructors. They presented the course material in a very clear and concise manner while relating the subject matter to applications in the field. Much mahalos!"
1344,This course provided very useful information that is relevant to my position on a daily basis.
1345,Excellent course! Great content that is very useful and great instructing.
1346,"Course content was a bit more involved than what my job requires, but it filled some ESSENTIAL job knowledge that I was missing. I was directly able to address some questions I have with one of my operators, so the time spent was invaluable."
1347,Hands on was really good.
1348,Very effective - understandable and progressive instruction.
1349,The instructors did a great job presenting the material.
1350,"Bob, Lou and Jeff are Excellent Instructors who take their time to explain the system and gave me the knowledge I need to work on the equipment with confidence."
1351,"Dale, Bob and Stan did a great job of conveying the information. And their knowledge of the system was extensive and deep. They were able to answer any questions I had thoroughly."
1352,Wes was a very rude and coinciding to many students. Tim was very helpful with what to look for.
1353,Lessons such as aircraft characteristics could be presented earlier in the course as well as learning airport and navaid identifiers. The map practice while very welcomed in class was something that could be reduced in class to allow more time to practice early nonradar concepts su
1354,the instructors were very knowledgeable and very approachable when in came down to asking them questions. Mike and Charlie are awesome. very motivating and were always pushing us to do better.
1355,My understanding is that the course was more geared towards the field office operations rather than being generic.
1356,Longer Sim time to fully understand operational limitations of the technology or deficiencies to be identified in training programs.
1357,Karl had several positive comments regarding this class and was enthusiastic about what he had learned.
1358,"The course is well-written, but should be pass/fail to minimize cost, if an employee does not grasp the concept or can perform the duties at an acceptable level."
1359,Good class. Should be mandatory for 1825 ASI's
1360,Ask me again in six months when I have actually managed some designees.
1361,"Cecil Claytor and Mark Johnson were both excellent instructors. Cecil is excellent and catering to individual learning needs while keeping the entire class on course and making the learning environment fun in the process. Mark's experience in the field shows, and his knowledge abou"
1362,"This ""New"" way of conducting the course (non-EHOT DOP) did not detract in any way from learning the actual material. But that fact is mostly due to the effectiveness of the instructors"
1363,"both instructors were very knowledgeable, and helpful. We even got another instructor who jumped in to help us more and be able to understand the course better."
1364,Thomas Lynch and Mike Ortega were the most approachable instructors during my time at the Academy. Both were very knowledgeable. I especially liked that Thomas referred to the SOP everyday to enhance our learning and things that are allowed during scenarios. Sometimes when we asked
1365,"The instructors were helpful and knowledgeable. However with the new materials, many had different solutions to each problems which were confusing to some of us. Some solutions were incorrect while others said it was correct."
1366,Instructors are all very knowledgeable and helpful
1367,none
1368,"I would add in order to rebuild relationships with operators where trust has been betrayed, it can take up two years to do. During that time it will be a very fragile journey. Much like in a personal relationship that has suffered a trust betrayal, for instance in a marriage. There"
1369,"Chuck is an excellent instructor. Great command of the classroom, and his technical acumen, from both the terminal and enroute options shows. great subject matter expert. very personable and his dedication to his job is reflected on the great quality of instruction. thanks!"
1370,Chuck was very knowledgeable of Air Traffic Technical Training and training administration. He supplemented course material with his personal experience which was particularly helpful to me. He also asked one of the members of the class who had experience at headquarters as a natio
1371,excellent
1372,"I feel that an extra week of radar practice would have been helpful. It would give us more time for the concepts we learned in the first couple weeks of radar practice to sink in. We're given a lot of material and the best way to learn it, in my opinion, is to be exposed to it mult"
1373,Mike and Charlie are great instructors
1374,They are a perfect team and need no changes to their lesson plan and how they instruct.
1375,Having to prepare for the CKT prior to having evaluations detracted from our focus on problems. Earlier problems should be more difficult and paced more slowly. The sections on longitudinal and lateral separation should be longer with more scenarios. Information needed for the CKT
1376,Jeff Phillips and Dave C. are very knowledgeable and work great together. If you do not understand what one is explaining the other will say it in a totally different manner which will make sense.
1377,"The course, overall, was a good course with a lot of information. The information that is given to you is so much. There were multiple days where I spend hours at home going over the information from the previous day. Just when I was able to understand some of the more difficult si"
1378,Jeff and Dave are amazing instructors and want us to pass. They have boosted my confidence and motivated me on a daily basis.
1379,"Ensure every one has at least a basic understanding of departure criteria. We know that these days the process relies on a tool for the ""expertise"" factor in the job."
1380,Extremely well presented. It was obvious both Michelle and Jill are passionate about the course subject and I can't imagine two other individuals better qualified to not only present but also develop the course material.
1381,"Dave, Matt and Shannon are my favorite instructors at the academy."
1382,"The instructors for this class are so knowledgeable, and I'm really glad I had the oppurtunity to take this course within two months of moving into my new position. Very well put together course."
1383,Sometimes I just felt the course was going to fast. for some lessons we could use less time and for others more time.
1384,I like how Cecil threw us into the phraseology from day one and we have been practicing every morning.
1385,I have not taken this course. It appears as though this is an ATC course and I am an FLM within the Delta CMO.
1386,Having to edit problems and substitute strips in the non-radar labs ended up taking a lot more time than originally anticipated.
1387,"By the time the course was over, we had been taught by over a dozen instructors. I feel it would have been beneficial to have fewer changes in instructor. It would have enabled us, as students, to get more comfortable with a teaching style and more comfortable and familiar with one"
1388,None.
1389,"Rich Wiggins should be a lead instructor in my opinion, very knowledgeable and helpful when asked questions to explain."
1390,Kent Story is a wonderful instructor
1391,"The course was good, it would be nice if the FSDO people had a separate course from AIR and MIDO because the issues Flight Standards deals with rarely involve manufacturers or certification of new products."
1392,Great class and well taught!
1393,Best course so far. Great Instructors!!!
1394,No longer employed with the FAA
1395,The course was beneficial in helping the employee prepare for future promotions. It allowed the employee to see the bigger picture and how to operate as a middle manager.
1396,good course
1397,The course is long but necessarily. I found that a large amount of material was covered effectively. Highly recommend it.
1398,"Professionalism, experience, helpful, patience, we couldn't ask for more."
1399,I found the instructors to be knowledgeable and helpful.
1400,RNAV material is hard to understand for folks that have not had RNP class.
1401,Course material and lab gave more hands on the transfer switches and more detail knowledge of the equipment.
1402,No. The training was good!
1403,Instructors were very effective in maintaining interest and conveying information. The tag team aspect kept the instructors fresh and energetic.
1404,Room was too cold
1405,This was an excellent course. The instructors were true subject matter experts with experience and applicable knowledge to back up the presentations.
1406,"Great course! Definitely a LOT of information, but it was presented thoughtfully and I feel I have retained quite a bit. The instructors and training equipment were more than adequate."
1407,"Overall the course was great, we covered the aeronautical charts in depth. If any student had a question the instructor made sure to answer and explain it until the student understood."
1408,Closed: Sat
1409,"Roy and Joe were both very effective instructors who took a shared interest in our success. Joe needs new materials for his jokes however, I only laughed at like two of them. (Joke)"
1410,The data link portion is in need of discussion of D-ATIS and PDC over ACARS and AFIS.
1411,Instructors immediately expressed their availability and willingness to help. This made the class relax and comfortable.
1412,Jason and Fred knew the subjects very well and were always approachable.
1413,The instructors Rich Green and Rich Wiggins are the best instructors here at the academy. they are very professional and very knowledgeable. they are really good teachers and they care a lot about the students. It has been an honor to work with the 2 Rich's!
1414,"Michelle Prine and Jill Schenewark did an excellent job presenting the material. It was obvious they knew what they were instructing, and had a lot of experience in the subject area. Regina Brock did a great job as Course Manager, she insured the course flowed well, and there were"
1415,Employee elected to attend however the skills can enhance her performance in her current/future position.
1416,Instructors were great!! Approachable!!
1417,Instructors were very knowledgeable and more than willing to help with any questions.
1418,This course increase my skill knowledge and should help make my job more understandable
1419,"All instructors were great. I really enjoyed the way they broke everything down. Also, each instructor kept reminding us of what we learned in the last lesson."
1420,"Gary Butler did a great job at teaching the class, even thought he was only an A-lead he primarily was our main teacher. His enthusiasm and love for the career was very easy to see from day one. Gary always said if you give us 100% we will give you 150% back, which couldn't be said"
1421,I don't feel the course was long enough to properly cover all the material or to allow a sufficient amount of lab time. Materials were good.
1422,"I'm not going to get specific. Just keep doing exactly what you are doing. This class really has been one of the most straight to the point, no fluff classes. I heard this from colleagues prior to coming down here and I will say the same thing, as we have another guy headed down he"
1423,Class was effective and taught the basics of how to build the departures.
1424,more lessons on reading the radar screen and the equipment would be helpful.
1425,Tim and Rainer were AWESOME
1426,Add more practice questions/activities in the book.
1427,It was nice to have an instructor who had been in the field. He was able provided real world examples to show the importance of what we were learning. I feel like that was a very important part of the course.
1428,Instructors were great...knowledgeable and helpful
1429,Course was well delivered and informative. I have not yet had the opportunity to perform an En Route inspection.
1430,A++++++++
1431,Instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful. No complaints.
1432,Good
1433,Overall I was impressed by the course and the instructors. The instructors did a fantastic job of running the course in a way that enhanced my knowledge while making the learning environment fun. The 3 week course had an immense amount of subject to cover and the instructors did we
1434,Great instructors
1435,"Less time in basics, lots of wasted time there that could have been used for more TSS simulations."
1436,Mike Hakim is great
1437,"Take controller judgment away. Students are not being judged on their own experiences or techniques, but the instructors."
1438,A lot of material jammed in a small amount of time
1439,"The overall course was good. The addition of the flight check brief helped understand the ""big picture"" better."
1440,My lab instructors were great.
1441,Besides not following the class syllabus. The study materials followed well in accordance with the lectures. Surprised when exam was given earlier than the date on the syllabus.
1442,"Course was very fast paced, sometimes too fast on subjects that needed a little more attention. Non-radar practice problems could have been a little harder to better prepare us for evaluations. Radar scope 1 in the radar lab was sometimes hard to read because of glare and what look"
1443,Overall the course was very straightforward. I do think that the SOP's should be introduced way earlier than they are. Going over the SOP's a week or so before entering the lab and then not doing the worksheets until around Day 49ish just seems really late. It didn't really hamper
1444,I feel like the best thing the FAA could do to help out students on this course would be to add more lab time. If we could somehow add at least a day or two to radar I'd be willing to bet that it would help the lackluster pass rate increase.
1445,"Overall, our instructors were great! Very helpful."
1446,"Finally, after 10 years, was able to obtain training. Learned many shortcuts and know what I have to do to fix when I return to my office."
1447,Overall this was a very good course. It gave me an understanding of the overall VORTAC systems.
1448,"More lab tab should be built into the course due to the lack of equipment availability to most technicians in the field. also adding the TPR portion back into course would be helpful, especially with all of the confusion with the e-TPR program."
1449,"Very disappointed with the topic of the course, not what I expected. Specifically it was not what I wanted or needed. I had believed this would be a class on the technical aspects of the duties of a principal inspectors and found out it was about interpersonal relations. I became c"
1450,A lot of information was crammed into the session. Another day would be better to spend more time on subject matter instead of rushing through it.
1451,The course was overall good. Perhaps the first 2 weeks could have been completed at home and weeks 3-5 in class (OKC). Linux and networking was good for hands on portions but the earlier information seemed a bit unnecessary to learn in person.
1452,The slides really need to be updated and the flow changed.
1453,"The course did a good job teaching the concepts as designed. There are people from many different backgrounds and different related jobs. It's probably not practical, but it would be nice to have a short follow on class that deals specifically with my job function and the computer"
1454,"While the course states that it is designed for off the street knowledge, it has a high ""assumed knowledge"" requirement. Being CTI was imperative."
1455,The instructor were knowledgeable and approachable. Presented to the class in a professional and interactive manner that provided good class chemistry. We enjoyed the additional narrative provided by Mr. Deck and his insight to flight check. The explanations were excellent and the
1456,"Since attaining the new hirer course, I think this course first 15 days should be only covered in the new hirer class. That can add more 5 days to the end of the new hirer class."
1457,Exelent
1458,This person is no longer my employee
1459,"Our A-Lead and Lead (Charlie/Mike) are both great instructors, especially together. The only big complaint I have about the row instructors is that they do not know how to grade us evenly. Each writes more or less, or just doesn't write much at all. Even when they do write they don"
1460,instructors were all very helpful
1461,"Again, I feel this was a very well presented course. It could have been a disaster for me if the instructors were not so helpful and knowledgeable."
1462,I haven't had a basic TERP's course in over 3 years and this course was instrumental in knocking off the rust.
1463,"Practical exercises were valuable, and a good start. This course would be most valuable if it were 3 weeks which would enable new inspectors to have solid POAs upon completion. The simulators are most useful for this course - just not enough time allotted. The short/insufficient ti"
1464,TARGETS DP training was well organized and structured for what we do.
1465,Enjoyed course very knowledgeable instructor
1466,Jay and Gary were both very knowledgeable about Aeronautical Charting and did a great job of presenting the material to students with a wide range of aviation experience. I enjoyed the course and definitely learned information that will assist me in performing my duties in Airport
1467,One more week running both radar and non radar scenarios would be very helpful. The timing between the ckts and evaluations is not conducive to material comprehension.
1468,"We had almost every instructor on your roster which was good for experience and learning names and faces but getting all these different teaching styles was a detriment to our learning. For future classes, please do a better job of scheduling ONE instructor for ONE class, so that t"
1469,Doc is a very knowledgeable instructor. He answered all my questions and looked up the information if needed. I look forward to my next String PAW class.
1470,Bob Enoch and Larry Ross were awesome! crowd management was a plus. Wish more sim time was included with the course to fully understand Nuances of NEXTGEN.
1471,you need to revamp this course
1472,"I really enjoyed this course. While I felt I had an understanding of basics from CTI and RPO experience, I was surprised how much of the material felt new. I'm glad I didn't opt out of the course. The instructors appeared to enjoy teaching the material and gave career advice above"
1473,"Coming off the streets, I felt like this course provided a solid background to get me up to speed and prepared for En Route school."
1474,The new style of course presentation and content is vastly improved. The information was presented in a way that is instantly transferrable to performing a job function. Moving to this new style format could benefit the work force in other classes.
1475,Great instructors and great content. George and Tim were exceptional. Only thing I would suggest is to label the exercise papers when it refers to them.
1476,All three instructors were great they kept the class attention and provided the needed levity to get through the dry material.
1477,Lewis could use a little more energy in his lectures.
1478,Our lead instructors for this course were great. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The row instructors were a mixed bag. Some instructors were insightful and patience and had a very positive impact on my learning experience. There were others however that were basically the oppo
1479,"The course teaches you the tools you need for the job, however some of the rules or procedures that were done at the Academy have almost no impact or need here at the center. Some of these things that were worth a fair amount of points during evals or that may have cost people pass"
1480,None
1481,Excellent. Were available for questions at any time.
1482,Good course overall.

1486,Course was well organized.

1489,"Mac was great. If someone was asking a question about a scenario and we haven't covered that topic yet, he would stop them and tell them that we will cover that later and that if he answered it at that point it would confuse everyone. Gary on the other hand will tell them the answe"
1490,Great Instructors!!!
1491,Excellent!!!!
1492,Really like the pace of the course. The instructors were very knowledgeable and loved to help us understand everything!
1493,The instructors in Radar were all great. That includes the lead instructors and the row/lab instructors. All of them were knowledgeable and helpful.
1494,The overall class content and material was good. I had no prior experience and felt I have learned a lot over the course. The material could have been more geared to En Route students vs. over all ATC.
1495,"I am very grateful for this course, material, and the way it is all carried out. I think it provides for a great, thorough, fast paced learning environment and I know I benefitted greatly from it."
1496,This is by for the best FAA class I have taken. The material was presented in a manner that was very easy to understand and it grabbed everyones attention. David and Cindy worked very well as a team and I would love to come back for a class with these two instructors. They were ver
1497,Dave Yerka is the best instructor I have had here at the academy. His enthusiasm and laid back approach creates a great learning environment that allows the student comprehend and absorb the material presented. Dave has exemplary knowledge of the equipment and his teaching style al
1498,"This class is very essential for a PI. However, regarding the scheduling of this class and many of the concepts and tools it provides, particularly with stress management and effective time management and triage, this class SHOULD BE provided to ASI's prior to becoming principals."
1499,Sandi Herbst and Walter Bogart are great facilitators.
1500,The staff of instructors is highlighted by the professionalism and commitment to alumno0s for the class is very objective.
1501,"At this stage of my career, I can gain little from the theory portion of this training. I feel that if I haven't learned to effectively communicate with other humans at this point in my life, I may simply not possess that ability. I recognize that it may be beneficial for others, b"
1502,Some instruction on Kindle use would have been helpful as some students were not familiar with them.
1503,"I wish we had more time in between block tests. there was one day that we covered a whole block book except for one lesson and had the test the following day. I felt I didn't grasp the material as best as I could have. The food in the ""laughter café"" is way too overpriced. my wall"
1504,I loved learning from most of our Instructors but I would tune out one of the instructors we had in our class room. You could tell that it hurt my ELTs and Block exams because I would not know the answers to the lessons he taught us.
1505,Very helpful
1506,One thing I thought could have used some alterations were the list of identifiers/airports we were given. Some airports were called or referred to another name then what is provided in the list of identifiers. It certainly added some confusion for me.I think the SOP could use more
1507,my instructors were great. rich and rich did a great job explaining all topics and im very glad they were my instructors for the course.
1508,"Ray is quite the instructor. When you have an instructor that is as knowledgeable as him, it makes for an easy and effective learning environment. Thanks Ray"
1509,EHOT/DOP should be brought back.
1510,Instructors knew the equipment very well and were always helpful.
1511,More emphasis on accuracy codes would be beneficial...other than that the course was great.
1512,The lead instructor Jeff was nothing but outstanding throughout the radar portion of the training. He has a thorough knowledge of air traffic control and can provide excellent methodology when solving air traffic situations. The only thing I can say is that I do wish there was a mo
1513,I feel the instructors did the best they could with the limited amount of time they had to teach this complex course.
1514,"Another great course with 4 more left. Looking forward to the training, glad to be with the FAA."
1515,"Richard & Tom were outstanding in the discharge of there duties. Both always had time for a question, explanation or request for help. I thoroughly enjoyed this class having them both as instructors."
1516,"Please read Part 2, comment one. Instructors were outstanding."
1517,All the instructors were well prepared and did a great job with the presentations.
1518,With the start of my second career being the Teaching Administrator and the one that will be administering the training now at my facility I felt this was an awesome course for me to have in my training bag.
1519,Excellent. He challenged us at the appropriate times to ensure learning.
1520,The course was well organized and utilized the latest edition of computer software required to complete the associated lab exercises. Course content adequately addressed the course objectives.
1521,Mr. Currie was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.
1522,"Electronic manual is much more useful for me to use. I do find problem with searching in One Note. It does not list all of the search word. For example I searched for ""recharge"" and it never took me to the right page for the information. I found it manually by using the index."
1523,Experienced instructors.
1524,I wish there had been an extra few days running non-radar problems.
1525,"there needs to be a definitive study material for the ckt. the evaluators when we run our practice scenarios should get together before hand and discuss how the want the class to handle the problem, because all the different evaluators are contradicting the ways they tell us to exe"
1526,Technically I was told that I needed the course to access the data for PDC Data extractions. I told the instructors of the course that it was a significant waste for someone to have to travel and sit through a three day course for a job task that requires three keystrokes. I explai
1527,The course manager seemed somewhat detached and lack much enthusiasm. He was definitely not giving 100%.
1528,"Really liked the labs! The classroom material gets a bit dry, but the lab brings it back around."
1529,"The content, material organization, and labs were very helpful and informative to my duties and responsibilities as a POI."
1530,"Course was very informational, current and relevant. Presented in a well organized, logical manner, that made it easy to follow."
1531,I did not like the U-shaped desk layout. I would rather have a traditional layout with a 48 inch desk layed out in rows. On person always had to move around the room to get to his work cubicle. The layout worked well for lecture but some students had to turn around to look at some
1532,Employee was scheduled for class but didn't attend due to scheduled leave.

1535,"All instructors were knowledgeable, patient, and easy to work with."
1536,"It would be great if the hot links from the slides were active from the student desktops. Also, for day 1, when showing the features of WebOPSS, it would be much more effective if the actual WebOPSS program were used, instead of PowerPoint slides. If you are going to use the PowerP"
1537,Course was definitely intense. Felt overwhelming at first. But the instructors did a good job repeating and answering all questions we had.
1538,"This is my favorite class to go to as a good booster to my knowledge, or a refresher. I always look forward to this one."
1539,The instructors were excellent and sincere. I felt like they really cared about the material. They have a wealth of knowledge and I feel fortunate to have been in this course.
1540,I felt the course was ran timely and efficiently.
1541,It is hard to provide this critique because of the fact that we had 7 or more instructors. Most were very knowledgeable and friendly.
1542,"Over all the instructors were all very helpful in one way or another but I will make Phil, Glen, Tim & Rick stand out because you can really feel they are passionate and dedicated to helping us and guiding us to success"
1543,Mark and GQ are absolutely amazing. I'm very happy to have these guys as my leads and have learned so much. These two made us feel like home.
1544,"Instructors were great! The only negative comment I would have, is having multiple instructors throughout the course. It was hard at sometimes because of all the different teaching styles. Overall though, they all did a great job in helping me succeed."
1545,Remove last presentation.
1546,"For the scenario based exercises, I felt not quite prepared enough. However, the intent was achieved and I wish there was more time available to practice administering oral and flight simulator. These exercises were extremely valuable to me, especially the part 135 scenarios, where"
1547,"1. The course is too short for the level of impact the design tool plays, will play, in the national airspace development. 2. The course should be at a minimum 5-days and an off-site course to prevent student distractions from workplace responsibilities.3. An advanced course 1 or 2"
1548,Instructor Most did an outstanding job explaining any questions we had.
1549,Excellent and appropriate
1550,The instructors were very knowledgeable and presented the materials in a very structured fashion.
1551,The course was very informative and the use of the SIM presentation was Great!
1552,Awesome!
1553,This course may be better served via eLMS and Adobe Connect instead of travel to OKC.
1554,I am a CADRE and as such was my duty at this offering.
1555,"Too much time spent on classroom discussion. Not enough lab time. Lab rooms not available to for after class study. Some of the instructors I had were very nice and helpful, where as some were very condescending and not helpful."
1556,AShley Bueno is not my employee.
1557,Lessons were stretched out and took more time than they needed to be.
1558,"More practice in the TSS labs, without the instructors help."
1559,"Instructors were great, very knowledgeable and helpful."
1560,Delete the interpersonal skills portion of the course and add course content that will improve the technical skills of a principal inspector.
1561,Instruction was outstanding
1562,Jose is an excellent instructor - his teaching style is very effective!
1563,"Although some of the course material was in the process of being updated, the instructors were able to improvise somewhat. This improvising resulted in a course that was still effective despite the needed updates."
1564,Would be helpful if the class would address interlock issues. That seems to be the most reoccurring issue in the field.
1565,"Course should have taught the current criteria, not the old criteria."
1566,"Instructors have been good overall. Lead instructors have been helpful, but seems that the row instructors need more training. Everyday it seemed row instructors were saying what you can do and can't do and it contradicted the row instructor from the previous day. Everyone has thei"

1568,The instructor's experience and enthusiasm kept the course interesting. Thanks!

1570,CONTENT OF THE COURSE WAS EXCELLENT AND ORGANIZED APPROPRIATLY
1571,Instructors where very knowledgeable and did a great job teaching
1572,Thank You.
1573,"Good content, like the WBT day and more importantly the Airbus A330 orientation session."
1574,"As a member of Flight Procedures Team, I felt like our aspect of the OE process was virtually side stepped all together. I can mostly understand why, AJV-15 has their slopes, we have ours derived from all together different criteria; however, maybe the course could include a broad"

1576,The instructors were extremely knowledgeable.
1577,Instructor was very knowledgeable and helpful and ready to work with students when problems arose.
1578,great instructors. great knowledge of industry and enroute inspections.

1580,"Excellent course. NOT just ""touchy-feely"". Enjoyed varying styles across multiple instructors. Thank you very much to all of them for an enjoyable and fun presentation of a relatively remedial topic. It SHOULD be common sense, but isn't always and there is always room to improve sk"
1581,I as leery about coming to this course. I now look forward to working with ANI on the conversion of our VOR to a Doppler VOR.
1582,the course content REALLY needs to match the handouts and examples. IT would enhance the class and reduce confusion
1583,"Instructors were great, and I normally don't like group sessions because the people don't all participate, but this class they were able to get full engagement, and it made it all the better."
1584,"Excellent lab instructors who balanced professionalism, learning, and levity to help trainees learn."
1585,"Our instructors were very knowledgeable. Our lead, Roy, always answered our questions in a timely manner and I felt took a personal interest in each of us and what we struggled with so he could better coach us in and out of the lab. Joe, our A-lead, was knowledgeable and willing to"

1589,The course was very well designed to learn the rules of Aero Centre and apply them in such a short time. The only downside to this course was that having to remote pilot for problems took away seeing problems for the first time. It was really like only doing 13 of the 27 problems d
1590,I wish the CBI pre-req was an ELMS course or part of LAB course...
1591,very good Jim and Jim-bob got a good handle on things.
1592,The instructor was very knowledgeable and made sure every issue risen was answered in an understandable way
1593,Perhaps one of the best industry courses I have attended in the past 10 years.
1594,All instructors were very knowledgeable and patience
1595,A lot of material had to be covered prior to our 30 minute presentation. Think they did a very good job.
1596,Instructor was knowledgeable of program. A preview of future capabilities would greatly benefit. TARGETS does much more than DVA and the class should have focused on that as well.
1597,closed SatMaybe add some instruction and/or advice on techniques to deliver negative feedback to DPEs after an observation.
1598,Lead and assistant instructor were great.
1599,Both Roy Harris and Joe Stapleton were very easy to work with and explained situations and ideas very thoroughly when I had questions. They helped me throughout the beginning of the course and it seemed they both wanted nothing but success from any of their students. For problem in
1600,"Most of the skills learned at the academy will severely atrophy by the time they are used at the facility, if the training could be split up or done after being introduced and trained at the facility it could be more useful."
1601,This course was full of great content. The time frame given for all of the information was insufficient. I feel that we could have gone into more detail if we had more time.
1602,Excellent COURSE
1603,Rob Mizell is a God among men when it comes to teaching RTF. He deserves a raise. All the other instructors in the labs were extremely helpful as well.
1604,"Both of our instructors, Cecil and Mark Johnson, were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Both of them were approachable and helped all of us to feel comfortable here."
1605,Instructors memories phrase helped. And stories connected to the lesson plan
1606,"********* Overall, the course covered a lot of material well. It prepared me for the duties of a STARS SS. The use of outdated equipment was acceptable but, at least early, there was little comparison between the G1 system and the G4 and Elite systems. As the course progressed, mor"

1623,I appreciated face time with our regional leadership in past courses but this time it was very limited. Regional Directors let us know 5 minutes before they were supposed to show that they were in OKC? More training on IPM would be appreciated.

1627,good knowledge from instructors on the applicable regulations in regards to course material. good discussion on current industry environment. Good course.

1633,Both instructors were wonderful
1634,It would be nice if the instructors could go over the windows based software.
1635,Being able to work with a windows based terminal would of been helpful instead of only going back to DOS.
1636,"Both Instructors were fantastic and made this material easy to understand. As a Past Instructor and facilitator, these guys have mastered the delivery. Great Job!!!!!"
1637,Rob seemed to go off topic many times
1638,"All matched perfectly, was not confused on any questions."
1639,Course is significantly longer than it needs to be. The presentations are very repetitive 3-4 lectures could easily be condensed into 1-2
1640,"The tables in this room have cover panels installed that are very easily kicked due to their proximity to our feet. Students accidentally kick these panels while adjusting their feet. This results numerous loud ""bangs"" all throughout the day. This is very distracting and is detract"
1641,The only problem with this course is the amount of material that really should be covered vs the time available.
1642,"Bob, Jeff and Lou are awesome instructors."
1643,The material was well laid out and properly presented.
1644,construction was going on at time of lessons.
1645,"Charles Heck and Justin Fortenberry are both very knowledgeable and professional.They are a good team, doing the best they can with less-than-optimal materials, classroom facility and presentation materials."
1646,Bring back EHOT/DLP reducing classes length to improve student thru-put but pushing the EHOT/DLP function on the field is the worst idea this year. If we need to increase student thru-put it is because there are not enough trained technicians in the field...now you expect the under
1647,Bring back EHOT/DLP...I can learn so much more in the Lab...my airport is extremely busy and getting a DME out of service so I can train on it is just not a reality other than between the hours of 11pm and 5am. The lab is a great controlled environment and the perfect place to lear
1648,This is the best part about schools in OKC we can experiment and try things on the lab equipment that we could never do at an active sight which really improves the learning. The instructor installed gripes are awesome tools to make me think and greatly improved my learning. There
1649,"The two students (ASIs) in attendance are already performing Airplane Evals, and thus were able to comprehend much of this training as a refresher or reinforcement of previously learned material. The pace of this course would be far too fast for a newly-hired ASI learning this mate"
1650,Charles Heck is a very knowledgeable ASI and very willing to make himself available to the needs of the students. He is both professional and personable.
1651,"Video's are out-of-date (they reference regulations that have changed)I'm guessing over a million dollars for a simulator, but not enough money to have WASS GPS approaches; that's extremely penny-wise and dollar foolish. Precision GPS approaches would better support ASI proficiency"
1652,"This is supposed to be a professional training environment.The classrooms do-not have multiple screens, thus requiring instructors to minimize programs to display other course materials. Multiple screens are needed.The instructors should have a screen at the back of the room so the"
1653,"I am a Helicopter Inspector - This course is crucial to my ability to perform flight evaluations. Unfortunately, this course does not provide an Instrument Competency Check (IPC) endorsement that would meet the requirements of 91.57(c).There is no OJC credit for this course. Why no"
1654,"The two students (ASIs) in attendance are already performing Airplane Evals, and thus were able to comprehend much of this training as a refresher or reinforcement of previously learned material. The pace of this course would be far too fast for a newly-hired ASI learning this mate"
1655,Organized well - But still far to short for a newly-minted ASI.
1656,Construction in the room next door.
1657,"The simulator-based training that evaluated the ASIs ability to effectively conduct an evaluation was extremely useful. An hour-and-a-half is not enough time for the Pre-flight Briefing, conduct a short evaluation flight, provide a Post-Flight briefing and conclude with required do"
1658,What little training that was provided was effective. This course needs to be two to three weeks to have adequately trained inspectors release to the field.
1659,The instructors were very experienced in these areas were able to cite examples that help make the topics much more meaningful to the class.
1660,The example videos were very out of date. Not all of the links in the presentations were working.
1661,There was nothing presented on Part 133 and Part 137 operations. There is a very significant need to include these areas into the course.
1662,"The course material did not devote sufficient lecture time to the EC-135 aircraft systems. This interfered with the testing of the ""applicant's"" knowledge if I did not know what they were doing incorrectly. The airplane course has extensive classroom time for TAA systems and specif"
1663,"There should have been basic POAs provided for the various types of practical, proficiency, and competency tests. This will help achieve a greater level of consistency that that upper management seeks. They could then be further refined by each ASI to meet the needs of their distri"
1664,There was not sufficient time in the EC-135 AATD to complete all of the tasks in the POA developed for each scenario.
1665,More time in the course for professional discussions would be appropriate. Much of the material is explanation centric.
1666,A few minor corrections were needed in the course books.
1667,"Some instructors were more distracting, which isn't bad because it simulates real facility feel. I think there could have been fewer distractions at the beginning of the course, though so students can concentrate on fundamentals."
1668,"I enjoyed the course very much, it is the 'bread and butter' of GA to evaluated safe airman that are going to operate in the NAS. An auditor with no airman experience will only make the NAS highly dangerous."
1669,"I don't think we needed as many super heavy a/c in the problems, maybe just 1 or 2 to see. I also think the course picked up really fast, where I think it may have been better to stay slow for the first day to solidify the concept. We also worked 2 wind problems which were great to"
1670,"Some of the functions like the min button and *P cones didn't work. They weren't necessary, but I am going from a REHOST system to STARs, so having full functionality will help me learn prior to my next facility."
1671,There were several occasions where two particular students would not stop talking over the instructors. This happened daily.
1672,"Jim the Faa instructor is very knowledgeable with this material. Both Jim and Jim Bob have a very in-depth knowledge of this system, they are able to teach in a very fluid manner since they can recall the information so well."
1673,The ventilation system was noisy and made it difficult to hear the instructor
1674,"The way in Which Faa Jim was able to teach was very understandable. He used clear terms to reinforce the information. Jim Bob is very good at explaing math, He can show through examples how to make it simple to understand."
1675,Both Jim and Jim Bob are very approachable during class and after class. During breaks they stayed in the class rooms to answer one on one questions about information that was covered before the break. they would stop class and ask if anyone had any questions during teaching which
1676,Each time and sometimes more than once the objectives would be displayed on the overhead board and written on the white board. I never at anytime wondered what what the objectives were.
1677,"the books are very well written, If I caught myself not paying attention I could read the material in the book and understand what we had just went over. I also would read the book and it would only reinforce what I had been taught by the instructors."
1678,Both Jim and Jim Bob would keep the the class free from outside talk and other issues that might distract me from learning. When others in the class would start talking about something else off topic Jim and Jim Bob would politely get stop the talk and get the class back on track.
1679,This course is very helpful with understanding a Vortac. I came into this class with very little knowledge of how a VORTAC worked and left with a great starting point to build on.
1680,Each day was very well organized with test being given in the afternoon. Labs where at good times to reinforce the material we had just learned.
1681,The order in which the material is presented is in a good order.
1682,The labs were well organized and it was nice being able to see the equipment and how it relates to what we had been talking about.
1683,The splitting of the class seemed detrimental to the conduct of the remainder of that day's lessons.
1684,"Maybe too much information right away, I do understand we only have so much time to do this though"
1685,Overall this is one of the best classes I have been to in Oklahoma in my 10 year career with the FAA. Top notch instructors like Jim and Jim bob are a very valuable assets to the FAA
1686,Labs where provided with enough time to complete the task and also ask questions during lab. I never felt rushed in Lab.
1687,Having the actual equipment and being able to touch it was a very good way to reinforce the materiel we had just learned. It was nice to have more than one system available so lab groups could be kept small.
1688,Very clear and expounded on the subject matter.
1689,Very helpful and explained the reasoning
1690,"even during after hours like at the gym, lunch time, etc."
1691,i'd request more time as a whole.
1692,"Initially, Roy Harris was slightly difficult to understand, as his teaching techniques are better suited for higher skill/knowledge level students. Once the basics of non-radar were grasped by the students, his teaching style was perfect for allowing the students to understand the"
1693,"Some instructors can appear to be a bit rude on first impression, but it's mostly a personality thing, all instructors I dealt with were extremely professional and knowledgeable about the topics being teached."
1694,"Some of the written material can be dry and hard to understand without proper context, but Instructors Roy, Joe, Jimmy and Mark were able to bring the information to an accessible level for the students."
1695,"I personally believe it would be more beneficial to have an extra week of non-radar lab practice, and take away 1 week of basics to make up for it."
1696,"As stated above, I think students would be better served with an extra week of non-radar lab practice instead of basics."
1697,The higher difficulty scenarios (after problem 13) were good at pushing students to the limit of their abilities and it promoted more learning than if the problems had been easier.
1698,"CKT 1 was a bit different than expected, compared to the End of Lesson and Block tests."
1699,"Began without covering the sop, then introduced traffic and coordination before thoroughly reviewing basic inbound and departure procedures. Earlier problems should be more difficult and paced more slowly."
1700,Having to prepare for the CKT prior to having evaluations detracted from our focus on problems.
1701,Michelle was probably the highest SME that has ever taught an Academy Level course.
1702,"A few of times the instructor displayed displeasure with when the course started and how they were not informed about the class starting. The course started with negativity. Don was not among those complaining, Don is a great asset."
1703,"Jill and Michelle made this course amazing. Their energy and positive attitudes truly made this course fun, and positive learning enviorment."
1704,See Comments in question 1
1705,during the lesson plans it would be helpful if we went over the material in a different way rather than have the class just read word for word out loud
1706,"I assume this will be helpful on the job, but I really don't know yet."
1707,"I always felt at least a step or two behind, despite studying and practicing regularly. I get the impression that I'm slower than most others, though, so it may just be me."
1708,Some topics were covered to fast.
1709,"Above and beyond Instruction, support, energy and effort by Michelle and Jill."
1710,Ap
1711,Being an FLM and attending this course will increase my ability to effectively manage our assigned designees. I learned a ton.
1712,The games really made a difference in this course as well as the incredible inspectors.
1713,some material was not updated with the Ks in front of the airport
1714,I feel like one more week of running problems would be helpful and shorten lesson time
1715,"There were times the course was moving too fast. Once the class was split in two, it was better paced, but there's a lot of material to cover for 4 days."
1716,Could have used more time for exercises
1717,"More time to run problems would be helpful. Also, having the CKT right before the non radar eval distracts us from running problems for practice."
1718,The book does not have examples that are always relevant to the problems. It would be better if the book could be tied in to running problems better.
1719,Some sections of the lesson plans could use a little more information like the 22 knot/44 knot rules section. These are actively used during non radar problems and besides the very few sentences in the sections of the lesson plan and the strip marking guide there is not much on the
1720,"We are the first class to run the ""new"" non radar problems with only 2 weeks in non radar. The problems given the first week were very slow compared to the (new) problems given the second week. I think having the really hard problems is definitely a plus but I wish we had time to r"
1721,certain students continued to sit next to each other and talk during lessons
1722,The audio and video system in the room presented a challenge for the instructors. It wasn't their fault it was just a challenge to operate because it continually experienced static issues.
1723,outdated material and videos were used in class. Some of the procedures presented are no longer used in the industry and can be confusing to inexperienced inspectors.
1724,very little of the reference info was printed in the handout...if you didn't take extensive notes you would not have the key points
1725,This course does not apply to anything I do in my current PD.
1726,"Course manager stood in the back of the class watching both instructors teach. He only came in at 6 minutes before the class, 5 minutes before lunch, and at 10 minutes before the end of the day."
1727,Course Manager was very intimidating and not at all easy to approach. His open briefing was unprofessional and not constructive in accordance with FAA HR manuals. He had no respect towards personal issues outside of work and was very quick to jump on someone if we checked an import
1728,This course does not apply to anything I do in my current PD.
1729,Course Manager was present and does not hold good communication skills with students. Course Manager was very intimidating and not at all easy to approach. His open briefing was unprofessional and not constructive in accordance with FAA HR manuals. He had no respect towards persona
1730,Instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful. It was also very obvious that the Course Manager's attitude and intimidating leadership approach reflected the first few days on us all. We stayed after 1630 most days because the Course Manager would show up 5 minutes before class s
1731,Great job by Rich and John
1732,I felt that presented the material in a way that made it easy to understand.
1733,Very approachable
1734,Just didn't read slides (like most OKC instructors do). She used real life problems and examples to supplement learning. Went beyond the 'rote' level of teaching!
1735,There were several points where the instructor indicated that the material was out of date or soon to be out of date and we would not be required to know or utilize the information while in the field.
1736,The course was a little slow for my liking but I feel that it was appropriate for other students so I was fine with the pace.
1737,Ray is phenomenal. There wasn't a question that he couldn't answer.
1738,"Lots of student participation, great job."
1739,nice use of games to keep the class energy high.
1740,There were quite a few fruit flies flying around the classroom that made it very hard to pay attention in class some days. Seems like a small problem but it was quite distracting.
1741,"Ray McLawhorn was extremely knowledgeable of both ATCS options as well as aircraft performance and pilot's environment given his background in flying, ATC, and aviation in general. Dan and Brian are both extremely knowledgeable Basics instructors."
1742,No real labs experienced in basics
1743,"The wording on describing some of the items were a bit unusual, I believe the wording could be improved."
1744,Too much time allotted for troubleshooting. This course is 3 days too long.
1745,8 students troubleshooting for one instructor was very inefficient. Could have used more instructor involvement. Don was the only instructor available for most of the course.
1746,"Just like someone looks into the mirror for attire, this course gave me a chance to look inward, and made me self-aware of my triggers, and more...Thank you for a great job."
1747,It is a bit too fast for me at some area I am not familiar with.
1748,Lots to this course could probable be longer.
1749,"Don was very helpful, Jack really did not participate much during the troubleshooting portion."
1750,End of lesson test did not appropriately reflect what would be on the block test for blocks 1-3
1751,the block test seemed more concerned with ability to catch small discrepancies and errors than the actual material.
1752,I cannot quantify the negative or positive effects that training and deploying students as RPO's has on their learning. Perhaps hiring enough RPO's to effectively run twice as many problems and keep student's minds focused on becoming controllers is less cost efficient than investi
1753,"Delaying this course evaluation by one day would have it follow our first graded evaluations, and would be far more valuable in determining the effectiveness of this course."
1754,the two instructors were very passionate about the course.
1755,some things needed additional explanation.
1756,There was a lot random stuff on the test that did not match what was focused on and preparing over the term. It was a lot of obscure stuff.
1757,It did not. It seemed focused on trying to trick students instead of focusing what understanding what they know.
1758,The instructors were great and very helpful on focusing making us prepared for both CKT and Evals. I still feel I could use another week or 2 practice with instructors watching us.
1759,There were quite a few errors in the NR Binder that led to confusion early on in the course. Instructors were made aware.
1760,Slightly fast paced for all of the information presented.
1761,wake turbulence information should be presented earlier in the course.
1762,Chairs are noisy.
1763,some lessons are too fast paced. mainly the lessons for block 3.
1764,Wake turbulence explanations and techniques should be discussed earlier to aid understanding of certain topics
1765,block 3 assessment was poorly written and had misleading Q&A's
1766,For some of us it was moving too fast. there was not enough time to understand information.
1767,Do to things out of my control my proficiency level was not evaluated properly.
1768,For me personally no it was not do to lack of accommodation
1769,Not enough time to fully comprehend material
1770,NR should be three weeks practice problems instead of two weeks. Too much time spent with classroom discussions.
1771,There should be a lab room to use before/after class time to practice on personal time.
1772,I wish the FAA would update their materials across the board to represent that content and intentions presented in the course.
1773,We waited for the entire class for light ballasts to be fixed. Still waiting.
1774,Jose and Richard are great.
1775,Some subjects were rushed to the point I had to self teach myself the material.
1776,Thomas and Mark were excellent instructors. Very thorough with taking to help students understanding different items.
1777,Mark and Thomas complementing each other. If one did not explain it well the other explained in a clarifying way.
1778,I believe an additional week of non radar scenarios would be beneficial to perfect non radar techniques.
1779,I think the world has moved further along than tearing up strips and computers should implemented for strip marking
1780,The materials covered during non radar did not appear translate to the CKT. A lot of the information did not match what was tested.
1781,Non radar is out dated and used in less and less places.
1782,We are just finishing up scenarios and would like 1 to 2 week more to really master the art of non radar.
1783,Another week of running Non-radar scenarios would benefit the student a lot more
1784,The NR-scenarios could be scaled up to difficulty better.
1785,The course material still had the Maintennance program requirement for RVSM as of August this requirement was changed.
1786,Some assessments have questions that are worded in a way that differs or makes it difficult to understand what it is saying. Also some tests have questions that seem a bit less important than others
1787,"The room temperature was very distracting. It is hard to pay attention when you are freezing all day, and trying to stay warm."
1788,"being computer illiterate, the instructor spent a lot of time on me personally,which helped me immensely"
1789,"Not coming from an ATC background, I struggled immensely trying to keep up with the new information which is not presented in a manner that it could have been completely understood in such a short amount of time. Maybe if given a little while longer, entire classes could grasp the"
1790,"I very clearly do not fully understand what was being taught to me over this short amount of time. Instructors have given me positive reviews, so I believe (given the right amount of time and at the right pace), I would have more success with this course."
1791,This course was clearly not designed to understand and learn the material coming from no background in this field.
1792,Asked several questions in class and all questions were answered clearly and to the full extent possible.
1793,"""Academy (AAC) ATCT Handbook"" is not properly updated with Table of Contents pages. Also, said handbook does not have the Pad Management appendix section."
1794,"""Academy (AAC) ATCT Handbook"" page 6-17 is somewhat confusing as there is no notation as to who is initiating the Runway Crossing Closure."
1795,Air conditioning was very cold and made learning tougher as I had to stand up several times to keep myself warm.
1796,some of the material said Lockheed and some said mcalester. some of the diagrams did not coincide with what is practiced here at academy for PAs.
1797,the room temperature is way too cold. all. the. time. it only makes me sleepy.
1798,a few of the lessons were so fast paced that I ended up having to teach myself. the lesson on tower visibility was awful.
1799,I love the table tops they are such a great tool for the part task assignments.
1800,Some of the information presented in the booklets was incorrect or needed further verification.
1801,Except for the blinking light that was reported but told it would take 2 days before maintaince could get to it.
1802,This course was too short to adequately cover all the material necessary. Lectures and labs were rushed through on more than one occasion.
1803,More time spent in the lab would have helped me.
1804,"It did increase my understanding, as I had none coming into this course. Additionally, Gary and Mac are very knowledgeable and helpful and I appreciated their instruction with the course material."
1805,"Not paced well, not organized well at all. The students that show a capacity to learn and willingness to learn should be able to have additional support through this course to ensure success."
1806,Some of the new NR problems need some updating from the mistakes on the strips.
1807,"Dave, Matt, and Jeff were great. They were very knowledgeable and able to answer the questions we had. If they didn't know the answer right away they made sure to go find it for us."
1808,Because of this being a prototype course there were some areas of confusion. It was also sometimes difficult to stay engaged as they read the required information from the slides per the prototype.
1809,Very knowledgeable and helpful instructors
1810,There are a few airlines we are using that aren't even in business anymore.
1811,"I understand there are many computers in this building that need to be cooled, but the classroom was quite cold every day here."
1812,"There are a few lessons that need to be retimed to reflect the material being presented. With the importance of wake turbulence in our jobs, I feel like that subject should be taught earlier in the course."
1813,"There were several days that the temperature within the classroom was too cold, which made it difficult to focus."
1814,I think that wake turbulence should have been presented earlier in the lesson plan.
1815,As a terminal class I feel some enroute material can be ignored and accelerate the basics course overall.
1816,"Some of the CKT questions covered material that had not been covered in any sort of depth in class, and some questions were worded strangely."
1817,"I feel the non-radar section could use another week of practice. It almost feels expected for everyone to catch on immediately, and that's just not the case. Just when I start to feel like I have a handle on maybe beginning to come up with restrictions in a somewhat timely manner,"
1818,"I feel like drinking from a fire hose does not support understanding and learning. We are thrown an incredible amount of information, some of which we barely practice or cover in class, but then are expected to test on the information we've barely covered."
1819,"However, I feel that there should be more practice for non-radar, as stated above."
1820,I felt the CKT 1 had numerous questions which I didn't remember ever talking about or covering in class.
1821,"We have yet to take the skill performance evaluation for non-radar (it's tomorrow), however word through the grapevine says that it's much more difficult than the problems we've been running in class. How is that helpful or effective in testing what I've learned? Maybe it's just he"
1822,"I feel this section could have been more effective given more time to practice problems, as well as testing relative to what we've learned/practiced."
1823,Gary more so than Mac.
1824,More time needs to be taken in the lab to better understand materials. To level off at a point before the eval's and practice at that level for a week would better enhance understanding.
1825,To take what a student would normally learn in a semester and cram it into 4 weeks is a bit much with the knowledge expected to be obtained by the end of course.
1826,The pace was too much and not enough time was taken on each concept to solidify them.
1827,No written assignments given. The inability to practice after class with instruction makes learning difficult.
1828,I wish we had more time to better complete our POAs. It felt a little rushed when I was trying to complete the 135 POA. It was an area that I wasn't familiar with and somewhat complex. I did not have time to type the standards into my POA which would have been helpful during the si
1829,all 3 instructors were excellent and constructive
1830,They brought their experiences while covering all course material in it's entirety. They gave real life experience to the slides which enhanced learning
1831,for the most part yes. However some of the exercises were not entirely clear and needed additional explaination
1832,"some of the videos in the slides were very out of date, and even had obsolete information"
1833,I feel an extra week of non-radar problems would have been beneficial.
1834,"Ceicil and Mark are both incredibly knowledgeable, and were very helpful in directing me in what to focus on."
1835,More one on one time would have been helpful.
1836,There were several times when subjects on the tests were not covered by lesson objectives.
1837,The Wake Turbulence lesson seemed to critical to be covered so late.
1838,"I feel that one more aatd familiarization lesson would be good, so students with less G1000 or Baron experience could focus more on the final evaluations rather than trying to keep up with what the plane is doing. otherwise, pretty good pace"
1839,"I would reorganize some of the lessons to preparing POA for a certain evaluation, then flying the sim right after that, over the last 2-3 days. POA in the morning, sim in the afternoon."
1840,I feel as though non radar should be spread out a bit more. Much of the information we received came at us pretty fast and it was hard to piece everything together when the non radar scenarios started. I feel like a had a pretty week grasp on the information when the practice scena
1841,"He was very helpful, patient and informative. He has a lot of good methods on remembering how to do things. He was a excellent teacher. He will repeat himself over and over even if you ask the same question until you understand completely o"
1842,The Best I've had so far!
1843,Minor errors in the curriculum however once we told Thomas he made sure to get them over to the right people to address the problem
1844,Thomas did the Best he can do with what little time we were given to prepare. I only wish we had hard problems and more time to learn information and run problems. Maybe 2 more weeks to really apply all the rules and see them more than just once.
1845,The book work material only made sense once actually running the problems for me.
1846,The questions were worded very unique
1847,Labs and more hands-on activities would benefit the course greatly.
1848,Sometimes the wording made the lesson a lot harder than it needed to be.
1849,We had a construction on site that made distracting noise.
1850,I feel that some of the lessons were too fast do to the amount of timing we have for the block test.
1851,"The beginning was paced correctly, in my opinion. However, although not difficult, the latter half of the course felt rushed. I think with a couple more class days and just ONE presentation, the same principles would be accomplished."
1852,Practicing running problems earlier would be more beneficial. More learning came from working one on one with instructors.
1853,Disagreement between book and instructors regarding RWY Crossing instructions
1854,Greg and Mike were great. Very informative approach.
1855,We haven't taken performance evaluations yet.
1856,"sometime it was hard for me to understand how Roy our instructor was trying to convey certain information, especially the first couple of weeks he gets really frustrated when you asked questions and didn't quite understand what he was trying to explain, in addition to the fact that"
1857,"In the beginning he seemed as if he didn't want to be there and he would answer you questions, but he wouldn't explain it very well, and I believe it's not that he doesn't know ATC, it's just that he knows it so well that he just explains it and expect you to get it the first time."
1858,"Sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't, I think for the stripmarking and phraseology we should have been told when, what, and where it would be used the most, in addition to knowing what phraseology from the study material was important for running non-radar problems. In addition"
1859,"Once again, sometime when the teacher was explaining things during class or at the end of class, it was always some students having there own conversation making it harder for me to listen to the instructor, in addition to them trying to explain while the instructor was explaining"
1860,"Most times we were ahead because the instructor rushed through the lessons and didn't really expand upon any topics or concepts, besides reading from the book. and having us read. Didn't really help at all!"
1861,I went home to figured most of the stuff out on my own or from other students or instructors when they came in to monitor our practice problems.
1862,"End of lesson test, and questions in the book were easy compared to the CKT 1 create more questions that reflect the CKT 1 test."
1863,Some of the materials were outdated. There was some confusion between online course assessment and what was shown in the basics book.
1864,basics communications needs to be moved to block one
1865,Needs updated but instructors told us at beginning and made adjustments throughout course.
1866,For me there wasn't enough time for me to absorb the materiel. Lab time in particular was too short.
1867,I would recommend updating the course material and separate it between terminal and enroute
1868,WAC and A/FD Outdated and no longer used in Aviation Community?
1869,"Some of the content, such as the Phonetic alphabet, seemed out of place in Block 5 and would seem more appropriate in Block 1."
1870,The real-life examples are very good - excellent learning!
1871,Need to update to meet new requirements (RVSM) and structure the evaluation questions to eliminate misinterpretation.
1872,"Course could be accelerated, and some information removed from lessons."
1873,Course could've been completed in a quicker amount of time.
1874,Would have liked to have seen more 22 KT or 44 KT rules used in labs.
1875,"The lead instructors were extremely approachable and helpful, as were most of the Non-radar instructors. One notable exception: Wesley N. Carter Sr., who was my instructor for Non-radar problems 23, 24, and 25, was unpleasant, condescending, and did not contribute anything positive"
1876,More time could have spent doing non-radar runs. Many of the problems were a bit easy relative to their location in the sequence of practice problems.
1877,The practice scenarios seemed to lack various situations that were discussed in class.
1878,"The book knowledge and real world examples are welcome however some of the realism is lost in the Aerocenter scenarios such as climb rates, what if scenarios, etc."
1879,The elearning while a good tool to practice skills did not quite prepare me for the testing that followed.
1880,I have to strongly disagree because I don't know how complex or busy of a scenario I will be facing when I get evaluated. We are taking this course critique before evaluations.
1881,"Overall I have learned very much from this section. The difference from day 1 and the end is huge. I cannot say it is effective or not because I have not taken the evaluation yet. I do say with certainty though that while I learned much, I have zero confidence facing the evaluation"
1882,we have substitute teachers which explained the material a lot better.
1883,somewhat
1884,some stuff were understandable some were not. specially running scenerios we will only practice the 20 mile rule once and was expected to apply at evaluations.
1885,I felt rushed throughtout the lesson plans
1886,A little too fast for my understanding
1887,A lot of the 91 LOAs were out of date (B036 and B039)
1888,There was a lot of note taking for this class when the information should be presented in the student guide.
1889,The practice problems that were presented were difficult to perform and seemed very fast paced in comparison to what we had been doing before then.
1890,yes they did supported the lesson but I felt like a guinea pig trying new scenerios no one else felt stress out most of the time many trffic calls they should be spacedout so at least u can come up with restictions faster I fell the calls took time from learning how to come up with
1891,"We spend a lot of time doing book work when I wish we just jumped right into identifying traffic and working different scenarios. By the time you get to the scenarios, it seems you are expected to have a deep understanding of traffic and seeing it when even now I still have a diffi"
1892,The slides sometimes seemed out of order. The workbook seemed out of order and confusing at times too. It would be hard to fix though.
1893,I thought I was going to learn more about how to do LOAs and OpSpecs instead of how to work WebOpss. I may have misread the course discription
1894,Rich and Jack are both excellent instructors who care very much about the performance and well being of their students
1895,"The ""new"" scenarios were incredibly advanced and to a point where learning was inhibited due to the student being overwhelmed by volume or over complexity."
1896,The instructors were not shown the new problems before we had to work them so they were trying to figure out how to do it while we were and did not always have the right answers. After a problem was over there were sometimes 5 different ways something was done and there were only 2
1897,Only few occasions the beginning of class was delayed due to unessential talk (recommended bars etc.) which was uninteresting for those of us who prefer outdoors and active activities rather than bar life. I felt we could have used that time more productively.
1898,only would like to see the time used more productive on those occasions when the conversation deviated to long to unessential and took away from learning time.
1899,Mac Campbell and Gary Butler were wonderful instructors. They are very knowledgeable about the information and very good at explaining it to attempt to understand it.
1900,"The academics portion of the class was very well paced. It was plenty of time to learn the phraseology, learn the concepts, and try to apply them as best we could. When it came time to running problems, it seems as if its a very short time to actually see the material be presented"
1901,In the labs we were given problems that we not finished yet and it took away from our learning experience. We should not have to be replacing strips during preplan time.
1902,With the amount of material to go over non there should be one more week of non radar labs. The student that were struggling or almost grasping the concepts were left behind.
1903,"Some of the new problems were too busy, you did not have time to complete all tasks. Even students that were in the top of the class were 4-5 minutes behind on calls."
1904,"The new problems are good but in some there is just too much going on to be able to learn, and even the instructors got lost or didn't have complete answers. When asked by instructors in the final days none of the students felt ready to take the evals."
1905,Mike Elliot did a great job explaining class material. Made it easier to understand concepts.
1906,"Some strips had the 'K' identifier for airports, while some did not, causing confusion on if it was the airport or a NAVAID."
1907,Construction at the east side of the Stafford building was loud and distracting at times.
1908,"FELT AS IF THE INSTRUCTORS WERE ""BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL"" ACROSS THE BOARD WITH THE NEW PROBLEMS AS THEY HAVENT SEEN THEM BEFORE AND WERE UNABLE TO PROFICIENTLY INSTRUCT THEM."
1909,"NEW SCENARIOS WERE GIVEN TO INSTRUCTORS WIHTOUT GUIDELINES ON WHAT WAS TO BE INSTRUCTED OR WHAT THE GENERAL LESSON WAS FOR THE SCENARIO. USING ""GET THE DME"" AS A SOLUTION EVERYTIME. THIS HINDERS THE MINDSET OF ""PREPLAN"" AS WE WERE INSTRUCTED FOR UPON INITIAL INTORDUCTION INTO NONRA"
1910,AGAIN GIVEN NEW SCENARIOS WITH OBVIOUS LACK OF PRIOR COORDINATION WITH INSTRUCTORS. MAKING THE INSTRUCTORS NOT AS PREPARED FOR INSTRUCTION.
1911,ENVIRNONMENT IS UNKEMPT AND FLOORS ARE CONSTANTLY DIRTY.
1912,NEW SCENARIOS ARE GREAT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A FIRM GRASP OF THE PROCEDURES BUT TENDS TO LEAVE THE ONES WHO ARE BEHIND WAY BEHIND AND REDUCES THEIR CONFIDENCE AND TENDS TO MAKE THEM SHUT DOWN AND NOT GET THE REQUIRED LEARNING NEEDED.
1913,VERY LITTLE PREPERATION FOR CKT. A GOOD AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS ON CKT WERE EITHER NOT INSTRUCTED OR SKIMMED OVER.
1914,ASK ME AFTER EVAL.
1915,"Chuck, Bill, and The Hammer did a great job teaching and helping us understand the material and the lab experience. They were very invested in our learning and taught us everything they know, in order for us to be successful by the end of training. Very thankful for them."
1916,SPEED REDUCTIONS OUTDATED
1917,I did not feel we had enough time to study for CKT 1 due to the new non-radar problems being so difficult and each day going home and practicing them over and over.
1918,The newer problems were to busy to understand the correct application on restrictions. Half the time you're second guessing yourself but you were unsure on the correct way to restriction the a/c from other. I believe there should be problems with less traffic to ensure students und
1919,Based on the intensity of the scenarios I'm unsure whether or not I'm properly issuing the correct restrictions.
1920,The instructors were very helpful and knowledgeable about the materials.
1921,Orders not up to date
1922,Knowledgeable and passionate
1923,Very friendly.
1924,"Many acronyms were new, so therefore difficult to initially follow."
1925,Course needs to be longer.
1926,"LESSON PLAN OBJECTIVES DURING CLASS FOR MY UNDERSTANDING SHOULD BE TAKEN SLOWLY, MAKING THE STUDENT READ OUT LOUD AND JUST GO THROUGH PAGES OF THE BOOK DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THE STUDENT IS ACTUALLY LEARNING. IF THE DURATION TIME FOR A LESSON PLAN IS 7 HOURS I THINK WE SHOULD AT LEAS"
1927,There wasn't enough time to present all the materials learned. The course materials did not provide enough information on a lot of different scenarios therefore when there were questions it was difficult to go back to look for a resource.
1928,The first room we had was small and did not provide enough space to learn in.
1929,the DOP test portion was not on the current version of the maintenance handbook
1930,No PPE was needed. We were instructed to assume those measurements were automatically good that do normally require PPE.
1931,IN MY OPINION THE NON RADAR PORTION OF THE TRAINING ESPECIALLY THE SCENARIOS SHOULD BE AT LEAST 3 WEEKS LONG. THIS WAY THE STUDENT SHOULD FEEL AT LEAST BETTER PREPARED FOR NON RADAR EVALS
1932,Gary was extremely helpful with any questions I had. I really appreciated the amount of time and effort that he put in to help me understand what I was getting wrong.
1933,"In the class room part of the class when we when over the lesson plans in the book, the instructors had the students take turns reading the lessons out loud, there was very little instruction during the lessons other than what was in the book. It was assumed that since it was read"
1934,"gary was very approachable and always tried to help. Mac was not very approachable to me, he would always just tell you your questing was not specific enough and he couldn't awnser it"
1935,just way to fast
1936,not at the pace it was taught
1937,The whole class was way to fast and to much information to learn in the time frame. No practice time other than map study. I wish there was a place on campus were students could go for one on one help or tutoring. They expect you to practice outside of class with class mates which
1938,"the part tasks, they just make you stand up in front of the class and try do demonstrate something you went over the day before."
1939,"they were way to hard and way to fast, they were more overwhelming and didn't create learning"
1940,AT TIMES THE BOOK ITSELF FELT LIKE IT LACKED SOME DEPTH IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND A SUBJECT.
1941,AT TIMES THE COURSE SEEMED RUSHED. IF THE POINT IS TO UNDERSTAND RULES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEM THEN TIME SHOULD BE ALOTTED TO FOR AN TEACHING AND LEARNING. in NON RADAR LABS STUDENTS WERE CONSTANTLY BEING BOMBARDED WITH NEW SCENAERIOS WITH NEW RULES WITH LITTLE TIME TO ACTUALLY UN
1942,NEED TO TAKE MORE TIME IN LEARNING APPLICATION OF RULES AND SEEING TRAFFIC. RATHER THAN JUST RUNNING PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM.
1943,"I FELT LIKE THEY DID BUT STILL LACKING IN THIS AREA. CANT RUSH THORUGH THE PROBLEMS. AS SOON AAS A PROBLEM FINISHED THE STUDENT RECEIVED A 10 TO 15 MIN DEBRIEF WITH A GO HOME AND FIX IT AND YOULL BE GOOD. THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR A STUDENT TO ACTUALLY GRASPED THE MATERIAL, ESPECI"
1944,CANNOT COMMENT ON THIS SINCE EVALS DO NOT TAKE PLACE UNTILL AFTER THIS SURVEY
1945,"AGAIN, CANNOT GIVE ACCURATE ASSESMENT OF OVERALL SECTION UNTIL AFTER EVALS"
1946,"The order of the lessons were not conducive to effective learning. There was a lack of building upon each lesson to make the next lesson more effective and efficient. I believe a more efficient order would be lesson 1,2,7,10,3,4,5,8,12,6,9,11,13. That way each lesson would be able"
1947,I feel that the amount of time given to go over academics for radar were not sufficient in allowing students to fully grasp concepts prior to lab.
1948,I feel that the course went by a little too quickly. I believe it would have been beneficial to have the course extended for an additional week or so. This would have possibly eased my doubts about having learned all the information that was provided.
1949,"For non radar labs 23-25, I felt a little uneasy about where my level of knowledge was while running through the problems. I don't feel like we changed pace appropriately enough. It felt as though as we went from one level to another in a day (from ""easy"" to ""difficult"")."
1950,Marion and the Daves were great.
1951,"The labs were fantastic at reinforcing classroom lessons, and clarifying abstract theory."
1952,Big fan of the mini radar!
1953,"During the non-radar problems, sometimes the traffic got backed up so that the technique that was being taught, would be hidden and not as much could be learned from that problem. I understand the need for more traffic to better prepare the student for the evaluation at the end, ho"
1954,"Being off the street, I felt that it was difficult to keep up with the pace of the course. Although I understand that need for it to be condensed, the course could have been stretched out to make more time to go over material. I feel like basics could have been shorter, non-radar c"
1955,"Small Classroom was distracting when there were more than 4 students in the room. With the ATD's running, the classroom was hot."
1956,The pace on Thursday afternoon and Friday was very accelerated. Back to back simulators did not leave time for a thorough debrief and then preparation for the next Simulator.
1957,"The basic course is okay. Learning was not supported in a basic ""building block"" approach. The subject matter was presented, the students were allowed a small amount of time to prepare, and then they were thrown into a scenario where there responses were evaluated without much (con"
1958,"Initially the first ATD as the FAA Evaluator(Part 135 Check ride)I was unclear about the evaluation standards, the applicant kept making obvious mistakes (that I was not catching), and then the applicant tried to kill me in the ATD forcing me to intervene. This was A LOT to throw a"
1959,Even the DPE in our class was critiqued on their performance. The expectations should be clearly stated (this is an introduction...it's okay to not be perfect...it is the stated goal of the course to present principles clearly and to preparing you for OJT).
1960,See above...don't feel like the course culminated in learning on the last day...only confusion and frustration with the lack of ability to evaluate an applicant in the controlled environment of the ATD.
1961,Acceptable pacing overall but could have gone faster
1962,Everything was rushed and the ckt1 and non-radar evaluations are one day after another. The ckt1 should be done AT LEAST 1 WEEK before the evaluations. This way we can study for the ckt1 while still learning how to manage our boards and then during the week of evaluations study for
1963,I found it hard to concentrate at sometimes because of the typing from people taking notes directly onto their computer.
1964,"Richard Payton was one of the best instructors we've had yet. Not only was he HIGHLY knowledgeable about current guidance, but he made sure not to teach only the outdated material that was given to him. He also kept an appropriate pace where other teachers in other classes have dra"
1965,"We were one of the first classes to run the new problems for non radar, we received a lot more information to prepare us for evaluations than the classes before us however received no extra time to learn all the new information. I think the new problems will really help with evalua"
1966,another week in non radar would have been helpful
1967,"There should be more focus placed on running scenarios. Book work and classroom instruction is important but we are being graded on the evaluations off of a scenario not a written test. More ""repetitions"" in labs will give students more confidence overall. The new scenarios took th"
1968,"The slides were out of date, but Richard kept us informed on current guidance."
1969,Very nice presentation and very professional.
1970,The sides really need to be updated and follow a better flow of how these are actually created.
1971,The information is outdated in several lessons and to aide in student understanding the slides have to be corrected when math and answers were not correct.
1972,"This should either be more than one class or the lessons should have more guided lessons instead of just the sides, then an exercise for you to try and figure it out on your own having to add several lessons together that were not given in order."
1973,Mike Elliott did an awesome job on the lessons he taught.
1974,I won't know until many months from now...
1975,Clarify the questions in the quiz
1976,Did not match up with current guidance.
1977,I did not perform to my proficiency level.
1978,We had a lot of issues with our equipment including having to move on several occasions.
1979,I would have preferred being taught on ARTS 3E since that is what is applicable to my facility.
1980,See comment below
1981,"The mandatory CBI pre-requisite is grossly outdated and needs to be completely abolished altogether! I learned more about the CEGS system on the first day when they did a ""review"" than taking the entire CBI pre-req course."
1982,It could have been shorter with less down time.
1983,Very helpful
1984,We had some technical issues in my lab. My speaker was not working for Jeske departure rolling calls for the first half of the lab scenarios.
1985,There were tangents a couple of instructors got into when discussing topics in the classroom. It made the topic more confusing. This mostly happened when NU was instructing.
1986,References and some information out of date
1987,Several slides in multiple presentations were out-dated
1988,MEL was out of date.
1989,Slides were out of date
1990,Two days of condensed schedules to make up runs from previous day made for hectic schedule and increased mental fatigue among trainees and trainers.
1991,The CBI course is very out dated and should be incorporated into the actual course material
1992,"Excellent environs: Classrooms, sims, computers, etc. all in good working condition. Very helpful. Would rather classroom course ware for take home (Drop Box) be available on big pc computer in class rather than iPad."
1993,would have liked to have more lab time for block 2.
1994,Construction noise
1995,Did not have a copy of the TI or JO available for reference and study.
1996,Kent did an extremely good job of this. Several of the other instructors that came through did not. Often they would just read the text straight out of the book with out any understanding of the material or would teach specific things that contradicted the text.
1997,I felt we spent way too much time on parts of block 3. In particular the chart activities took up a large portion of class and did not really teach anything above what was in the text. I felt that blocks 4 and 5 were rushed and could have used extra time taken from block 3.
1998,See chart activities from block 3.
1999,"He could have went into more detail about certain things, the CTI students would already understand the subject so he would move on while the off the street guys didn't quite understand completely."
2000,"This course could have been a lot shorter. Matt was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, however I believe he maybe expounded a bit too much, causing each subject to take longer than it had to."
2001,#NAME?
2002,The materials were adequate but needed better explanation
2003,Material was somewhat rushed and not appropriately spread out. Did not present a clear picture of what the system was doing and why
2004,Material was somewhat rushed and not appropriately spread out. Did not present a clear picture of what the system was doing and why.
2005,Although the entire lab was not available throughout the course which impeded the learning process
2006,Not everything was adequately covered. Didn't feel like I understood the material
2007,Not all of the equipment was available to provide a environment conducive to learning and understanding
2008,Not all of the equipment was available to provide a environment conducive to learning and understanding
2009,all instructor had a vast knowledge on this subject
2010,All the instructor kept the classroom participates very engaged in the subject
2011,some of the videos were dated.
2012,I'm unsure what would be classified as a lab or workshop.
2013,"Patient instructor, kept on task but never too busy to help."
2014,"Friendly, thorough."
2015,"When questions were raised, he was careful to answer the question(s) to ensure understanding."
2016,construction noise in the adjacent room
2017,Fred was very knowledgeable and very patient. This is a very technical course. I imagine it is very difficult to teach in an understandable manner. Fred was very good in his instruction.
2018,"Fred and Dave did an excellent job helping me. I was often lost and needed extra help. Dave often had to ""babysit me"" to help my understanding of the exercises and concepts."
2019,Especially with the help of the instructors.
2020,Fred was a pure delight to learn from as a result of his over the top enthusiasm for TERP's.
2021,The lab book needs to be re-written.Errors in student guide need to be corrected.
2022,The lab book needs to be re-written.Errors in student guide need to be corrected.
2023,Should have been a little longer with more real life scenarios.
2024,"The course was a little slower paced than it could have been. I felt at times that we were simply trying to use up time. That said, for someone off the street with minimal aviation exposure, this extra time would allow for them to study the materials in their off time."
2025,"Kent presented everything in a way that was applicable and easily understandable, the same cannot be said about some of the other instructors."
2026,"I did not have a lead instructor but I did enjoy them; Kent, Ray, Carly & Mr. Miller, etc. helped me to understand in laymans terms; Mark was very funny and made basics bearable; Maria was nice."
2027,Some things I learned in my en route class was terminal and I also learned some pilot information but nonetheless I think it served its purpose.
2028,The course seemed to be dragged on - did not seem as though the amount of time spent was needed - would have been good to use that time for review or in class study.
2029,DVA's are not widely used in my area of the country.
2030,Temporary destruction.
2031,"Our lead instructor was VERY knowledgeable. Some of the other instructors that came through for only select days, not so much and were unreceptive to questions that they didn't have answers to."
2032,"There Hand out exercises were not effective and not a good use of our time. It would have been more helpful to practice entering ""hypothetical"" 135/121 operator into WebOPSS. This way we could see the current OpsSpec and the different options available."
2033,construction being done outside often made hearing classroom activities difficult
2034,"With over 30 students in the room, there were way to many other conversations going on. It was difficult for 1 instructor to keep the additional chatter down. I would recommend limiting the size of the classes to mitigate the issue."
2035,Student to instructor ratio is too high.
2036,never went over objectives
2037,too many distractions
2038,EXCERCISES WERE A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME
2039,Course materials were lacking Elite functionality. Different procedures and process details are required when using DRD and USB media.
2040,The SS Lab book is severely lacking in process and procedures. The general student consensus between the students is that the Lab book was useless after the first week.
2041,Lead instructor was great! Other instructors from time to time tended to only read from book and not elaborating or making information more understandable to those without prior aviation knowledge.
2042,Lots of construction noise on last day during exam.
2043,There was construction in the classroom right next door and it was loud.
2044,The class room next door was under construction for the majority of the class time. Sanding vacuuming and other loud construction noises were very distracting.
2045,The exercise would have gone much smoother if the examples on the board matched or at least paralleled the desired outcome.
2046,too much down time due to broken lab equipment
2047,unorganized
2048,labs were broken
2049,use of training aids was not utilized by instructor. broken lab equipment
2050,it was broke more than it wasn't
2051,eh
2052,But instruction was not clear or explained very well. Was very hard to follow
2053,was not explained in a way that was easy to follow
2054,I wish we spent more time in the labs and running scenarios.
2055,"It is hard to say prior to taking the evaluations, however it seems like there is potential for there to be things on an evaluation that we haven't seen before a lot or used a lot which is concerning."
2056,Dude was pretty solid with his knowledge.
2057,"Was hit and miss with some things, but overall very well-spoken."
2058,"I missed one day due to sickness, although I know it was my fault, it was hard to try and understand the material on my own time."
2059,"Some classmates I'm sure strongly disagree with this, but that is because they weren't very good at non-radar, and they can't take responsible for themselves. I thoroughly enjoyed this course."
2060,"Some of the academics I think could have been shorter, and replaced with more lab work."
2061,The exercises should be given in paper form. It was very difficult to navigate between the lesson and the various manual excerpts.
2062,"Tim and Rainer were both extremely knowledgeable about the course. They both seemed to go the extra mile to make sure they not only could teach the subject, but also remain updated on how the system is used in the field."
2063,"Any questions were answered and if they didn't know the answer, they knew where or who to go to and had an answer in short order"
2064,It might have been difficult for anyone who came in with very little knowledge of how the system
2065,Excellent labs
2066,"The instructors did the best they could. The material is dense and more geared to an air carrier operation, which is a foreign field to me."
2067,Mike Hakim in particular was friendly and approachable.
2068,"Conducting this course on G1/G2 equipment may look cost effective from managements standpoint, but as an ELITE site person; the training would have been more positive with Elite hardware and established a benchmark."
2069,"Outdated Materials, Procedures don't even work with equipment. Using an outdated SSM that does not work and then explaining how you have to skip steps to make it work is not a good way to train someone who has not done this before."
2070,Doing labs on outdated equipment that does not reflect read world experience where as no members of my class even have a G1 string. All member were either elite or G4.
2071,This training would have been very beneficial had it been when I was a newer ASI. At the point of taking this class I had already taught myself how to use the webopss program.
2072,Construction noise in adjacent room.
2073,Construction/maintenance in an adjacent classroom was a routine distraction from class.
2074,"I feel the written test should have been done after the academics, not after doing labs for a few weeks. It seemed like a choice between studying problems on your off time or to study bookwork."
2075,I think this course is a good start to weed out the people who should not be controllers. I feel anyone who puts in the time in energy can pass this course.
2076,I am doubtful of SMS applicability to operators whose certificate I am likely to be assigned to.
2077,We were allowed to utilize the Elite equipment when we asked which helped to understand the differences and try to learn my new equipment.
2078,Construction going on next door.
2079,Room construction next door. This needs to be done when students are not in class or use a different classroom.
2080,Many lesson slides out of date
2081,Some subjects skimmed over
2082,There is too much information given in a very short period of time. Some of the items we only get to practice once before EVALS. I do not think that is enough for us to fully understand the material being taught and be able to perform well and apply it during EVALS.
2083,"With the many recent changes in WebOpss template changes, the slides for reference to the course OpSpecs were not updated."
2084,"Both instructors were encyclopedias of SMS knowledge. Their ability to explain the content in understandable and relatable terms was excellent, particularly with such a diverse group of students with varied backgrounds."
2085,I feel like I received a solid SMS foundation and will keep this information at hand as reference in the future.
2086,Instructor is already aware of new NATCA contract & changes to FDT.
2087,the larger class size was sometimes a distraction
2088,overly full class had delays and caused deviations from the schedule occasionally
2089,-It was difficult to hear the instructors about 25% of the class due to noise from construction in the room adjacent to the classroom. There was no attempt to relocate the course to a quieter area of the building.
2090,This course did not provide anything I wanted or needed.
2091,Some of the material was not cover more than once and it needs to be applied in problems in EVALS. I do not believe the amount of training provided in the scenarios are enough to prepare us for all the possible scenarios that we will be evaluated on. It was enough time to grasp som
2092,Both our Lead and our A-Lead were knowledgeable. Both were great when questions were asked.
2093,"Even though I was excited to learn about TBFM, we currently do not use it in my job. I am in severe weather at the Command Center."
2094,the examples did not match the handouts
2095,"with the amount of students, and complexity of material, as well as the gap in knowledge base. it was difficult to has everybody on the same page without side conversations, and people just not listening, and asking the same questions over and over."
2096,"The environment as a whole was free from distractions, however, some of the new problems caused a lot of distractions from instructors all wanting it done a specific way. It was necessarily the actual way the problem was solved, but more the way that each instructor said ""This is t"
2097,"I decided to choose disagree because I think that the course needs a little reworking. The course more then likely was paced correctly when in Non-Radar the old problems were presented. However, now that their are new, much more difficult problems the course became paced inefficien"
2098,"As stated in my previous comments, the new problems I feel helped me personally, but overall did not help most people. It felt as though the instructors were 'telling' me what to do in a pre-plan at the beginning rather than me actually learning the problem. Telling me to just writ"
2099,Tim and Rainer were both excellent resources for this material.
2100,There were some minor items that require updating but the instructors did very well at explaining those as they appeared and that updates are currently under weigh.
2101,This material is important to me as an ARTCC TMC however there are some lessons that are not well suited for terminal specialists.
2102,The pacing was excellent given the constraints of the schedule however in this case our class could have benefitted from an extra day to accommodate discussion between classmates on the issues we were covering. This was especially true when it came time to cover some of the advance
2103,"The group exercises were rushed, needed more time to produce a better product."
2104,"We had a large number of instructors, and some appeared to be more knowledgeable than others. My response indicates a perceived average of the many that we had instructing our class, but some were below or above this level."
2105,Rich and Mike were very effective instructor and made the course enjoyable and informative.
2106,This course will greatly help me manage my outreach efforts effectively to the public.
2107,"The performance evaluations I think did show my proficiency level when I had an RPO who could effectively run the problem. Out of the two PEs, only the first one I think showed where I actually stood. The second the instructor was stopping the problem multiple times to have the RPO"
2108,Use of the TSATS workstations was a very valuable resource in learning about a very complex technological platform.
2109,This course has an EFT of information to cover. It was very well organized and executed but I believe it will be necessary to split out content to be specifically tailored between terminal and center specialties particularly when TSAS becomes a more integral part of the platform.
2110,DERBB
2111,"The information content was up-to-date, but much of the content came off as severely dated, especially the videos. Many of our charts for block 3 were also fairly out of date and worn."
2112,"Some instructors presented the material in a way that was easy to understand, while others purely read out of the book."
2113,"In the PIREP area, the detection of sulfuric gases in the cockpit was left out."
2114,Class size was too large with the amount of instructors available to help.
2115,SHOULD BE USING THE SAS MOCK SITE TO INCORPORATE ANSWERING DCTS IN THE REAL SYSTEM.
2116,"This course could be shorter IF the class size was smaller. However with 36 students in this class, the presentations/classroom exercises had to lengthened out."
2117,The were too many students in class. So it took longer to teach the lessons which lead to a lot of side conversations.
2118,"I felt that if there were more instances of demonstration by the student(s) to drive more difficult points home would have been beneficial. Especially for students which were OTS, course material such as phraseology, and airspace would probably come easier with physical practice un"
2119,"We didn't have a lead instructor. Some (Kent, Ray, and Carly) were very knowledgeable and helpful. Some had just started or had experience working in an environment not applicable to that lesson content."
2120,"They should come to a consensus on how the LVBD works prior to presenting it to the class, they had a ten min discussion about one of its functions in front of class"
2121,I wont be using this info
2122,It would help if the class was longer.
2123,Every question that we had was promptly addresses by Tim and Rainer.
2124,Some of the examples were outdated the quality looked as if it was from the 1990's
2125,I feel as if the course didn't go into detail enough on certain things that could've been described a little better or something like asking a question the instructor would be like well this is all you need to know
2126,"We had several instructors throughout our course. Some instructors appeared to be in training. While I'm sure all instructors were knowledgeable, not all had the experience or knowledge for every question we had. ex: asking a career tower instructor questions about the en route env"
2127,"Occasionally, we'd have an instructor read verbatim from the course material. While not detrimental to our training, it'd be nice to not have such dry material."
2128,"While not completely free from distractions, the distractions were welcome and appreciated. An example would be a story from the instructors experience or a joke."
2129,Feel there needs to be more stuff brought to the forefront earlier in order to practice more. Have never seen different scenerios that you see within the last week or less. More practice with 44/22kt rule earlier show FRC on strips starting way earlier didn't see an FRC until last
2130,Unable to say at this time because I have yet to be evaluated.
2131,The message entry test is %5 percent of the total grade it did help on. However with the Radar evaluations with are 66% of the grade not helpful at all.
2132,I do not remember any labs or workshops that were made available.
2133,I have not taken any labs.
2134,I have not taken any labs.
2135,RPOS and a few R-sides require some additionally training. RPO error's were common.
2136,"I feel that immediately throwing a student under water, and then keeping them there is not congruent to a positive learning environment. I didn't feel that I was getting good practice in the problems until we were through with the learning points. And I feel that purposefully makin"
2137,"Although they supported the lectures, I felt that what increased my understanding was the lectures, not the labs/workshops. The labs/workshops only helped me to practice actually doing what I learned."
2138,When we did problems they encompassed everything and then we were told it will be covered later. I find it difficult to learn concepts I have to use if I don't understand them. Waiting until the very end to try to put together the pieces to me felt a lot longer of a process.
2139,Floors in the classroom continue to be dirty and unclean can tell they haven't been swept.
2140,"Spent more time in non-radar which only accounts for 14 percent of grade, when radar is worth 66%. Feel more time is needed for 66% of our grade and our careers. With only 2-3 weeks practice."
2141,"I believe the course should be extended a few days because by the time you begin to understand the massive amount of information, that is being taught to us in such a short amount of time, you are taking the evaluations."
2142,The instructors in the lab do not know the SOP very well and we are always getting mixed information.
2143,"Jeff and Dave were very knowledgeable ERAM, radar the course information and Air traffic."
2144,There was a lot of information compressed in a small amount of time. I believe adding an extra week would have been very beneficial to this course.
2145,"Depends on who was teaching, sometimes storytime got a little out of hand."
2146,"Again, Storytime."
2147,More time allotted for radar practice.
2148,Haven't been evaluated.
2149,haven't been evaluated.
2150,"Helpful for message entry (5% of grade), but absolutely no help for evals (66% of grade.)"
2151,No help for evaluations when all you have is message entry practice and they don't talk back and there is no interaction.
2152,"The instructors were very knowledgeable about the information, However I feel that the instructor do not have the best teaching technique, Even though they know everything about aero center and eram, they could use more instruction on teaching technique."
2153,"The academic/bookwork portion of the course was a lot of wasted time in my opinion, I would have been more beneficial to use that time practicing pointout situations, handoff's, emergency's and phraseology. The lesson plans on radar vectoring and weather is basically useless at thi"
2154,"The classroom learning environment was great. The eram lab was not, a lot of row instructors and R side are rude and offensive"
2155,There was a change in how to handle FRC halfway through the class when it was optional in the SOP
2156,"While most of the material was understandable, some of the information was hard to discern at our current education level without instructor guidance."
2157,"While the pace was strong and enabled us to learn quickly, it constantly felt rushed. Another couple days would have gone a long way and it felt that without committing most of your off duty hours and weekends you would fall behind."
2158,Some row instructors were more thorough than others
2159,I felt like the Leads know a lot more about the SOP's and LOA's then the instructors. Some of the instructors should brush up on the SOP's. Getting conflicting information about a subject we have such little time to learn can be frustrating.
2160,"In my opinion to make this course and training more effective it should be modified with at least an extra week in ""nonradar"" running extra problems and focus the radar training more on point outs and eliminate whatever is not necessary for us to learn at this stage of our training"
2161,"Some non radar strips had airports without the IKAO K in front of the airport, it would be nice to have some consistency on the strips. Also, the new non radar strips had errors on the strips and we had to manually edit them. I suggest having better quality control for non radar st"
2162,"I am off of the street and keeping up with non radar was extremely difficult, I think if we had one more week of non radar scenarios, it would benefit us greatly!"
2163,There are aircraft in the database that are no longer in service with the airlines and with the military
2164,This course has a lot of information in a short period of time. With the amount of money spent on people and the time that was invested in them. The overall pass fail rate for the program with more fails then pass that is a lot of money being wasted.
2165,Scheduled for evaluations next week so I cannot give an opinion on this.
2166,"Jeff and Dave are extremely knowledgeable. However, when running simulations I had some trouble with discrepancies between what I was being taught in the classroom and what the instructor for my scenario thought I should be doing. There's no time to have discussions about what to d"
2167,Some of the aircraft we were told to memorize learned about don't even fly anymore.
2168,Classrooms could use new chairs. Current chairs are very squeaky.
2169,Many row instructors tell you different things that isn't what the SOP or The lead Instructors have shown the class
2170,Row instructors didn't teach the same way to learn non radar students had to spend more time finding out what is correct for Aerocenter and what is incorrect
2171,"It's no secret that the course moves at an extremely fast pace. Though the information can be a lot to handle at times, the amount of information that is covered in such a short period of time can often be overwhelming. The course needs to have more information about radar display."
2172,"Like I said, once you get in to radar, you hit the ground running. Academics are very well outlined and the objectives are met. Once you get in to the lab, the information is often comparable to drinking out of a fire hose. There is no easy way to go over the material in the ERAM p"
2173,Instructor Michael Baptiste was very approachable. Instructor Ray McLawhorn did not seem interested in teaching the class. Made some of us feel like we upset him the whole time and made the class unpleasant at times.
2174,"Some of the material is a little out-dated, as instructors would let us know also. Not to the extent that it hindered our learning, but knowing that some items are out-dated made me feel that we were missing aspects of the job."
2175,In reference to the lead instructors Rich Green and Rich Wiggins. Their knowledge of the material and the way that they presented it made this section of the course easier to navigate.
2176,Rich and Rich have been amazing instructors and are always more than willing to assist in understanding anything I had issues with.
2177,The training was with a group of inspectors that had obviously been using webopss for some time. For that reason the course moved very fast and I found it hard to keep up as someone who had not used webopss at all.
2178,"All of the instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire course. One instructor Ray Mc...(I cant remember the entire spelling?) would sometimes be condescending if we didn't grasp something immediately, and often would leave some students feeling discouraged"
2179,It would seem more appropriate to either start the nonradar practice scenarios sooner and have more time to run them with the instructors one on one. This would allow the students a better understanding of the things they may have done incorrectly and allow the instructor to go thr
2180,It became frustrating when some of the row instructors would teach us different than our leads which caused confusion. It would be nice if all of the row instructors were on the same page as our leads.
2181,Our class had the updated nonradar scenarios so there were multiple times the strips were not complete and we were having to add/replace information on the strips during our preplan.
2182,I have not had the opportunity yet to use this training.
2183,See above.
2184,there is a lot of material to learn in a very small amount of time. the problems seem to increase at a level where it seems nearly impossible to keep up with regardless of the amount of hours that had been put into studying at that point
2185,The lead instructors Rich and Rich and Rich W's stand-ins were great.
2186,"In many situations there seemed to be excessive word usage to convey a simple concept or meaning, often leading to unnecessary confusion."
2187,I wish we started running harder scenarios sooner to help us prepare better for evals.
2188,I already new how to enter data in WebOpss before the class
2189,"By the time I took the class, I had a lot of experience with WebOpss and did need the training."
2190,I thought it was going to be more about how to do my job as an ASI and not another how-to-enter-data course.
2191,Sometimes people talking while you are on runs can be a distraction. Including instructors when they are trying to explain something to a monitor. I would suggest to speak to both monitor and local/ground when the problem/ scenario is over.
2192,I would recommend to always combine the instruction with practice since it was hard to understand how it the theory was put into practice. If they are done together understanding will be a lot quicker and meaningful to the student.
2193,The TSS is out dated. They are not user friendly starting with the pace or way the computer talks. Then the computer comprehension to the different accents.
2194,It helped me better understand how radar works.
2195,I Felt I could have used more time in Non radar. Particular more practice building strip marking and phraseology skills before the scenarios began or at least before the real hard problems began.
2196,At times it felt as though we did not spend a sufficient amount of time on position specific lessons or topics.
2197,Sometimes the TSS labs would shut down or stop working in the middle of a scenario. This was mitigated by resetting the computers which was cumbersome at times.
2198,We should have ran more problems before evals to ensure that we were getting it and everything was working not just 10 days worth of evals before something that is extremely difficult and people have never seen before.
2199,The CKT for this section and the book material should be worded the same in order to show if the students better understand the knowledge or not.
2200,The CKT did not reflect my knowledge of this section the CKT was written in a way to confuse and therefore show a score lower than the actual knowledge of the section
2201,The ROW instructors were quite different from what our instructors and what the SOP and LOAs explain. Lots of inconsistency with what we are taught and read. Made things difficult to understand some concepts.
2202,"I could definitely used more time in this portion of training. Even without the snowday, Which compressed our run schedule for Radar scenarios it would have been paced too fast in my opinion. Having to run an extra problem each day cut our time with the row instructors short which"
2203,We were told at different times that we would not use the material or it would be done differently in real life.
2204,Thomas was the best instructor. Thomas skills and patient is a gift sent from heaven. Thomas always prepared us for the next day and kept us ahead of the game. He goes beyond to help us repeatedly understand something that seems difficult. Scott was very polite and helpful. Scott w
2205,Sometimes the instructors would want you to do things their way when we have been taught another way by Thomas.
2206,Most were fair. Some lack compassion. There are times were some would be very rude and yell while your on the phone and running your problem. I had a hard time communicating with the R-sides. They would be very rude and short.
2207,Maybe one more week of running scenarios
2208,I feel that my answer reflects all of our teachers except for Ray. He relayed too many irrelevant stories and didn't read from the book enough. I felt like I had to walk away from class and teach myself what we were supposed to cover that day. This method of teaching seemed fine fo
2209,There were a few bugs in some of the problems but overall the lab equipment was good. The close proximity of the stations kind of made learning difficult at times. For example many times I heard someone next to me give a clearance which tipped me off that there was something wrong
2210,"Thomas Lynch was extremely knowledgeable. The SAIC instructors were not as knowledgeable. All instruction by SAIC was mixed, confusing, wrong or misleading from A lead instruction."
2211,"Thomas Lynch was very understandable and easily understood. SAIC instructors were not. Aggressive, easily aggravated, harsh tones, extremely poor understanding of how to present subject matter to students."
2212,"Thomas Lynch was very approachable and helpful in all ways. Although, SAIC instructors were not. Need to be taught how to actually teach and encourage students to succeed. SAIC instructors had bad attitudes towards student success."
2213,"Curriculum is not at all conducive of student success. Restructure, you will have a much high success rate than 40 percent."
2214,SAIC instructors during radar and non-radar scenarios were extremely poor overall. Does not support a learning environment. Bad attitudes and excessive yelling. Horrible environment.
2215,Vastly poorly paced. Not whatsoever conducive to student success. No wonder the failure rate is high! Change this.
2216,Scenarios due to SAIC instructors made the overall learning environment poor.
2217,"Evaluators are to be rumored to be extremely misguided. To extreme, in grading thus causing a very low success rate."
2218,"I found it odd that we are taught how to vector in the lesson plan when we do not use it here at the Academy. I think focusing more on what the D sides job task is, would be more helpful."
2219,"I understand why it is so short, but to increase the pass rate, a few more weeks should be added to the course. This would help perfect skills and techniques for the evaluations."
2220,another week would have been helpful.
2221,"The lead and A lead were very knowledgeable, however the lab instructors had mixed levels of knowledge and mixed levels of engagement. Some instructs paid more attention than others while you were running a problem so therefore you level of instruction varied with each instructor."
2222,"There were a handful of items in the book that our instructors said were no longer valid, but we had to know them as stated for tests."
2223,"One instructor, named Ray, made the material very difficult to understand. Every other sentence he would tangent off into a side story and rarely stuck to the book. Had to re-read the material and try to block him out most of the time"
2224,"It is very fast paced. There were definitely days where most of the class felt behind or lost. I understand that training time is limited, but even adding one or two more days of practice problems might help ease the transition to the harder problems at the end. They come up quick"
2225,"Not effective. Needs to be restructured, period."
2226,Need more lab space for students to excel.
2227,SAIC instruction made good equipment poor due to horrible instruction.
2228,"some of the lab instructors didn't seem to know the SOP, and gave wrong information that our lead had to correct on multiple occasions"
2229,I don't think there was a question Jeff didn't know. Jeff knows his SOPs like the back of his hand.
2230,If someone didn't get it the first time Jeff would try to explain it in a different way so the student would understand. Jeff was a big help! Jeff needs a raise.
2231,I would say the worst distraction I felt during this entire process was seeing other students who did not pass being paraded through the halls. That is not the type of message that should be given to students to encourage their study habits and passing. I'm honestly not even sure h
2232,There were areas that could use improvement. If we are expected to understand overtake situations than we need to be taught how to better use the actual radar scope and vector lines. There is zero time spent teaching you how to use the radar scope yet we are expected to use it comp
2233,Seems as though the books are getting to be a little outdated
2234,Lots of talking among students while instructors are talking.
2235,Our class had six instructors over the course of the month. They were all knowledgeable but most of them were not familiar with the en route environment which is the focus of our class. It would have been nice to have instructors familiar with the field we will be entering but it w
2236,"It is clear the instructors do not have a background in education as some of them teach in a dry, direct from the book manner. While all of them told stories to keep the material relatable, interesting etc. some got off topic constantly and wasted a lot of class time, telling stori"
2237,Some of our lessons seemed to be behind the times in terms of what is currently going on in the field in the realm of navigation.
2238,"Depending on the instructor, we either had too much time or not enough. Often times we were killing time because we breezed through the lesson. On the other hand, another instructor would take up all of our time, not necessarily relating to the course material, and it looked like w"
2239,Another week of radar practice would be helpful.
2240,Sometimes the halls ways can loud and hard to listen.
2241,I'm not sure why there was a lesson plan Radar Vectoring and Beacon Code assignment. To me that was a waste of time. We do not radar vector or assign beacon codes. It would have been more helpful if there was a lesson plan just for point outs.
2242,I think there could be an extra week for ERAM.
2243,Haven't taken ERAM evals yet
2244,"Jeff ""the Father of ERAM"" is a god send."
2245,We had an instructor that would act like it was a hassle to answer some our questions.
2246,Not all course materials were correct and up to date.
2247,"We had an instructor that did far more story telling than instructing. He was also incorrect on multiple occasions, when he would actually teach."
2248,Rich and Rich welcome all my questions and find different ways to explain things when I don't understand it the first time.
2249,The course needs to have a week less of book work and instead use that week to run problems. I am sure a lot of us would do much better if we had one more week to run problems with the remotes and row instructors.
2250,"all multiple choice tests provide the most basic form of grasping the actual material. It's much easier to recognize the best out of four options. However, it is more difficult to recall the information with a fill in the blank type format, matching, etc. I'm not saying I didn't pr"
2251,Some things in our books were out dated and some videos were watched were many years old. The ATC BASICS practice exam available online often had outdated and sometimes absolutely false information.
2252,With the sheer volume of information that we are required to know more time to study would have helped tremendously.
2253,Should have spent more time in Radar Labs vs doing bookwork.
2254,"The course facilitated rapid ingestion of massive amounts of information, with comparably little time understanding through application in the Radar Labs."
2255,I believe the course was paced a little too quickly to truly grasp the fundamentals of becoming an Air Traffic Controller.
2256,"I believe if we were to have at least one more week of radar lab scenarios, the entire class would have felt a little better going into the evaluations and too not worried about whether or not we understand what to do."
2257,Mostly due to the lack of time running scenarios (11 Days). I always felt I was trying to catch up to the problem from before. I would suggest instead of cramming the whole book in before scenarios begin is to either review the chapter a day prior to running the scenario or once yo
2258,"The modus operandi of the Academy is rapid ingestion of massive amounts of information, with relatively little time to become familiar with application of those procedures in the Radar Lab. Overwhelming the students day after day seems like a poor approach to comprehension. A gradu"
2259,Needs more time
2260,"Being that we went through the whole book before scenarios, at least for me it was hard to remember all the materials in the book"
2261,"I'm sure a lot of people comment on needing for time, but I wish we had more time...Instead of spending a month learning basics I wish some of the time went to non radar."
2262,"Having it be so short, I really felt rushed and confused at times with the scenarios being ran I always felt a few days behind."
2263,Many of the strips need to be updated with ICAO identifiers and had plenty of strips where manual entry was necessary
2264,Have not yet had a need to use TARGETS for departures
2265,"TARGETS is a tool. My skills do not require a ""tool"" to be effective. It simply makes it easier. If your skill is based on use of a tool as opposed to actually KNOWING the criteria then well, you are why Instrument Flight procedures is in such a poor state of expertise these days"
2266,"Training was for Targets Departures, not something we use a lot in the FPT but is a building block for future training for approaches."
2267,Again having needed it yet
2268,"The ground control crossing coordination phraseology was changed halfway through the lab exercises. I am unsure if this was because the procedure was changed, or if because the course materials were out of date originally."
2269,"In my opinion, monitor positions should be randomized more effectively. Many of my monitor positions were spent monitoring the same one or two people."
2270,Lab time should be broken up by classroom instruction to re iterated rules and standards.
2271,"some contractor instructors are more concerned with you doing the problem how they did it at there ""old facility"" and not on meeting the standard or letting you work the problem in an approved way that does not match their style."
2272,some instructors want you to run the problem a certain way and will contradict what the lead instructors have taught. others will tell you what to do the entire problem even when you were not having an issue maintain separation. from that point on you are not learning anything and
2273,"lots of problems with voice recognition, some screens are too dim to use in a scenario others have very washed out colors."
2274,"I do not think the labs provide a good simulation of real life, the depth perception and visibility are not similar to what I am used to. on some labs you can barely see the person on short final and the aircraft performance and characteristics were not realistic."
2275,Some parts of the lesson plans contradicted what we were being taught because of rule changes.
2276,"Instructor did an excellent job making sure all students learned and understood, lab requirements"
2277,There were a couple questions that the instructor could not provide reference to a Hanbbook or TIBs as where the answer was derived from.
2278,Both instructors answered questions. I thought Robert was a little less personable though.
2279,Their were some out of date references here and there.
2280,Because of some formatting issues the page numbers in the student guides and the exercise book were significantly corrupted making studying difficult.
2281,the non-scenario tests tend to seem less important due to the low point values. I think that effects the way that some students study. They somewhat ignore the tests with lower point values for studying scenarios.
2282,"There were a few times when the equipment experienced bugs or wouldn't start. That being said, the people responsible for getting it back running properly were very fast at getting us back where we needed to be."
2283,Very fast paced program. a lot of information to learn in very little time. more time to learn the material would be great.
2284,Lab was very well done. It supported and reinforced lecture. The lab proficiencies were challenging but really gave you confidence about maintaining your system.
2285,"Like I said, the lab proficiencies were challenging and tested us very well."
2286,Good test equipment. The proficiencies tested them well.
2287,"Some areas were a little too fast for me personally, I probably would have benefited from a little more time in Non-Radar but I understand why the course is the way it is."
2288,"I noticed several glitches in the problems during radar, but was able to work around them without any real interference. When we were running seven problems a day there were several instances where the systems were clearing overheating and there was a noticeable lag when inputting"
2289,Only on a few occasions this happened but when I worked next to or with Megan as an R side I had a difficult time running problems. If I worked with her she would always tell me what I was doing wrong and would tell me not to kill her planes while I'm trying to learn. If I worked w
2290,"Ken would tell people that their answer to a question was incorrect, ask around in the class for the correct answer for a few minutes, and then say the correct answer, which had been said earlier. He would also teach something and then say he taught it wrong and something entirely"
2291,"Stephanie was constantly turned around in her chair, making jokes, or having side conversations. This happened every day and not once was she told to face forward. She answered questions out of turn, flaunted hundred percent scores, and was generally an uncontrolled egotistical nui"
2292,Ken Cheers was but some of the other instructors we had were not.
2293,I did not think we touch much on the Air Traffic Control part of our future job. Most of the basics course was similar to my ground school for my private pilot. Some of the information was important but a majority will not have a daily affect on our job as an air traffic controller
2294,"Throughout the course, We had several different instructors who seemed to have very little knowledge about the course material coving in class or was unprepared to teach the material in class. Several instructors would read directly out of the book and was unable to answerer questi"
2295,I think more visual aids would have been helpful. It helps to understand certain aspects when seeing examples
2296,Could of added VSCS in the lab so we can get use to it
2297,"There were quite a few things that we were told is no longer the way things are done but for testing purposes, we need to know the old way. I would have preferred the material be how we are going to use it, not how it used to be utilized."
2298,"The first five weeks, we learned more about the physics of an aircraft and pilot environment than ATC. The only ATC instruction we were given was the last 3 days of instruction."
2299,"On several instances, instructors did not understand the material they were teaching which made it very difficult for students in my class to follow along or understand what they were talking about."
2300,"Going through different course materials, instructors would point out to students that some of the material they were teaching was out of date but we should know it that way because that is how it was presented in the book."
2301,"Up until strip marking, all of the material was understandable and explained well in the book. The last block seemed a little unorganized and the instructors had difficulty teaching the material leaving out some of it because it was ""not useful"" for us."
2302,I believe that most of the material taught in Basics pertained more for teaching us about the pilot side which is important because we deal with pilots every day and will have a better understanding of their environment and emergency situations.
2303,I do believe the labs and workshops supported the understanding of some of the material however several sections could have used video presentations and other hands on material to help students better understand the material.
2304,Some lessons were finished with time to spare and some we barely got through and would test on the next day.
2305,"Text materials not always reflecting ICAO identifiers (K###), small mistakes here and there."
2306,A month of time spent learning to be a remote for non radar was an incredible waste of time not being applicable to our job. It can be assumed everyone would have done a lot better if they got to focus 100% on what they will be evaluated upon.
2307,I don't feel as if much of what was taught pertained directly to ATC.
2308,"Some center controllers didn't know a ton about terminal control, but that was expected."
2309,Our class had about a dozen different instructors throughout which was a distraction when it came to adapting to how they teach
2310,"When able, see pass ratio."
2311,"All Excellent but - Ken Cheers, best instructor."
2312,many PowerPoint slides not updated and seemed to be wrong according to instructors.
2313,Stripmarking would be of much better use if introduced before the end of block 5.
2314,Labs consistently lag behind and/or crash completely. Our class kept track and at least one crashed per day resulting in us having to retake or restart scenarios. The lagging would sometimes be so bad that planes would be calling up over woody after they had already landed and taxi
2315,GARY LEBLANC took it upon himself to remove our things from our classroom. They were neatly put away in lockers and the room has more lockers than students. There is a green sign in the room that says WE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE FOOD AND DRINKS.
2316,"I know just about everyone had trouble with the voice recognition, myself included but I found that some of the RPOs would let weird things happen and/or miss something I said/did correctly but wouldn't fix it in time for another issue to appear. This would cause a distraction to m"
2317,"During our time in the breakout room another instructor removed items from the lockers which belonged to the class. These items were purchased for our class and removed without any prior knowledge or explanation for reason, it also took an extended amount of time for the items to b"
2318,"I feel that it would've been more helpful if the skill checks were actually graded like the PA. Therefore, it would provide a more accurate assessment in line with the grading tool."
2319,The glitches in the program (completely incorrect readbacks or maneuvers) at times take away from the learning experience.
2320,"Difficult to ascertain exactly where my proficiency level sat at during skill checks. Debriefs were brief, with little time to process what was gone over or mistakes that were made in addition to processes to prevent or correct those mistakes."
2321,Voice recognition software was subpar during some runs. Some of the headset plug-ins went out when the wire moved.
2322,Cecil Claytor and Marc Johnson are great at teaching the classes.
2323,"Marc Johnson and Cecil Claytor are very approachable and helpful. Instructor Phil, Glen, Jim Armstrong, Tim, Bobby, Ron, both Dans, Dwight, Gary are great instructors during the TSS runs. However certain instructors need to practice people skills. We are not in the military and ins"
2324,The course was not what I expected. This course was about interpersonal skills which at this point in my career and with the management training I received in industry is second nature.
2325,It was a refresher for previous training.
2326,Thomas was very knowledgeable and very helpful
2327,Some of the information was not very detailed and had many variables
2328,It was a lot of information and very short amount of time and situations and instructors always changing. Everyone had different approach for how to do things.
2329,Once again a lot of information and not enough practice to really get the hang of stuff
2330,The information felt scattered and really didn't allow time repeat actions
2331,A lot of the information was not overall but focused on trying to trick us.
2332,gets noisy when taking test. everyone is using a keyboard.
2333,more time for troubleshooting would be very helpful to every technician.
2334,I don't think it is an accurate representation of my ability with runs in high stress do or fail situation
2335,A lot of information in short amount time. To me it feels like a conveyor belt of get as many through the course as possible and not take the time fully train students
2336,in the real world we are not timed to do a check. so its an extra stressor to most people.
2337,"it is always great for technicians to touch equipment, real world does not offer that much time. so the more time the better."
2338,Another day of practice problems at a higher level would have helped reinforce the concepts presented in the earlier practice problems.
2339,Some of the Material used outdated Manuals
2340,"Although I can only say from what I've heard, seeing as how I've yet to do the radar evals (which seem like an oversight, having us do this critique when we haven't yet done something it's asking us about...), I feel that an evaluator marking a student down on ""controller judgment"""
2341,We need to start VSCS training earlier. You gave us one day of non formal training to do whatever we want. I still struggle with VSCS today as well with other classmates.
2342,Scope 1in lab B is hard to see from the D side position and the foot pedal on sector 5 and 6 requires excessive effort to ensure the mic is keyed
2343,"Questions were bought, the answer was that is how it is. No explanation, of reference where to find information in the Maintenance Handbook nor TIBs.Lab exercises went great, the Instructor (Eric) was readily available to answer or help understand the procedures of the lab. During"
2344,"I wish the was errata sheet for each study guide or lab book, handed out with books, that would point out errors and appropriate corrections that needed to corrects. The PSR Book, Lesson 11 has either the same page number or no page number at all."
2345,"Learned alot about instructor personal life, maybe a little less need, could have possibly keep course lecture time on track with the proposed schedule."
2346,See number 7
2347,Videos and examples could use an upgrade.
2348,"During TSS practice, we were distracted by the removal of our belongings from our break room. On Monday December 12th, we came to work and did not have any snacks or beverages to get us thru the day. Most of us were distracted for of lack of energy. Personally, I was expecting to f"
2349,Newer instructors weren't quite the clearest on instruction.
2350,Not all instructors were as knowledgeable as others. Karlie was great.
2351,"TSS 3, 5, and 6 were very hard to work with. TSS 3 kept on giving wrong read backs (voice recognition issues). TSS 5 and 6 crashed in various occasions and had to be rebooted."
2352,"ken was the best, I think it has to do with age and he knew a lot of information that was very helpful"
2353,"It was a lot and at times hard to understand. Instead of asking if we had questions, They should have just gone over questions they think were pertinent and try to explain them"
2354,mike g is a nice guy
2355,objectives were scattered.
2356,a lot of it was mumble jumble and it was hard to understand. Instructors did decent but could've been better.
2357,This course could use less time in the classroom and more time in the labs. at least 1 more week to get more employees through and to fine tune the ones who are up to speed.
2358,half of it I don't think we'll ever use. Half of it we will.
2359,"the course was extremely quick and hard to retain and the elt's were the dumbest thing ever, they only do that to stress us out."
2360,we didn't have labs
2361,block 4 was not explained well enough.
2362,probably the dumbest thing about this class
2363,what lab?
2364,There seemed to be a lot of time we had to kill.
2365,the labs left steps out that made trying to complete very difficult. They need updated! I also think it would be nice if they explained what you were doing with each step. Sometimes I felt as if I was just typing in commands and not really sure what I was doing. I think if I was fa
2366,We had flying wild life within the room twice.
2367,The equipment needs a major upgrade for the time in technology. Fix the way it says call signs. king air 8 should not sound like KEY. Xray should not sound like X R A. HD screens and projectors are cheap for what the FAA budget has. Buy the HD. Make it easier for everyone and more
2368,UPDATE THE TECHNOLOGY. We have the technology to have nicer equipment.
2369,Some lessons were too short for the day.
2370,The materials is out-of-order from what I learn in college and my military career. It brought confusion to people has not been exposed to networking.
2371,"I do not believe this course is a necessary prerequisite to EAS Management for SOC personnel as none of my co-workers have taken it prior to EAS training and will not be coming back for it. Also, I have already studied CCNA routing & switching as well as linux bash shell in college"
2372,"Both Richard & Bill were very knowledgeable, we had a substitute when our primary was ill. That was the course manager...Todd is the professor /master of UNIX ."
2373,"Both Richard & Bill were very knowledgeable, Bill had a way of putting the ""techie"" speak into day to day context and using everyday analogies to help us relate. We had a substitute when our primary was ill. That was the course manager...Todd is the professor /master of UNIX but he"
2374,They made themselves available and were willing to try other ways of explaining to get the concept across.
2375,Richard & Bill both made a concerted effort to present the objectives and reference back to them during the lessons tying them together
2376,"the labs were predominately unclear, with dual meaning statements in the same step example...restart your system then INIT6 these are the same tasking and it made it confusing. And we had to enter different commands than those in the lesson. Also since we use KDE in lesson 5 not CD"
2377,Students should get hard copy review questions at minimum. Then labs requiring the recording of data should also be hard copy.
2378,Mike Orteca was one of the best teachers I've had on any level. Made the course very comfortable and easy to understand.
2379,"some would say it was too long some too short, I feel it was right...allowing for absorbtion and study of the material.If all people care about is a pass with no capability to apply and or understand...the length will have no impact. I wanted take away and feel this is right."
2380,"I found a barrier in the course presentation in that I know it was to introduce one thing at a time then build, but it would greatly help particularly in Mod 3-5 if we could get the big picture first, then break it down,..."
2381,"For module 1-2 yes for the rest, I found the labs not re-enforcing I just wanted to understand what they were asking for and perform it, then worry about trying to understand the lecture."
2382,I thought it was nice to build cables & connectors...practical and reflective of the real world.
2383,Some instructors definitely more knowledgeable than others.
2384,We had 15 different instructors. Some were better than others in the way that they presented the material to be able to understand.
2385,Could have been done in a shorter amount of time.
2386,room was very hot 80% of the time
2387,depends on which instructor? up to block three I cant count how many on two hands.
2388,Havent had to use the software since the training but probably will in the future
2389,"Although not a distraction, we had a few snacks and board games that we happened to leave over night since there was no written regulation saying it was not possible. When it came time to share the classroom (Monday 12/12/16) we packed everything nicely in the lockers. The only thi"
2390,I feel like an additional week or two of training would be great in TSS
2391,The labs are a good but the equipment should be Improved
2392,The TSS should be improved especially during the busy problems.
2393,all good
2394,no good
2395,student run they mouth too much sometimes!
2396,add an extra week for radar and non radar training practices!!!!!!
2397,"At times there was to much ""story time"""
2398,I feel like a week more in the labs would prepare us
2399,More time in both non radar and radar would greatly improve understanding.
2400,"More time is needed overall in this course, should be apparent due to the abysmally low pass rate."
2401,I feel the radar course should have a shorter academics portion and a longer lab portion to better prepare students for evaluations at the end. There should be more time in the lab.
2402,This portion of the course had a much better pace than the non radar portion.
2403,"I wish we had more time to practice runs. The pace was on point but wish we had an extra week for fine tuning purposes. If we cant get more class time to practice, maybe providing a lab where we can go to during off hours and actually be able to run problems with other people in ou"
2404,It all starts to make more sense in the lab. Lab time is key.
2405,"Roy was usually very helpful. Joe, can be confusing sometimes. It seems that he will get excited to make a point rather then to answer a student's question. For example, a student will ask about updating the datablock but he will get excited about instructing on another point of th"
2406,"If there was 1 more week I think it would be more effective and beneficial. You invest this much time and effort into an employee, you want them to succeed. Having an extra week would allow for the learning to be not as rushed but still a good pace and therefore make for a greater"
2407,"In the radar labs while running scenarios, due to the close proximity of the sectors, it was quite distracting to hear the student seated in the next position. This also created a false sense of knowledge because if the phone would ring or they approved something before you did, th"
2408,"Roy Harris was great, good insight and good techniques. Joe Stapleton was knowledgeable albeit sometimes too eager to relate ZAE procedures to real life, which is not necessary as this stage."
2409,More lab time please. Less powerpoints.
2410,"Both Roy and Joe are generally fun helpful people. However, Roy can get very excitable sometimes and will snap at students during problems. Although, we know that Roy is just getting passionate about helping out it has the effect of stunning the student mid-problem. If he could rem"
2411,I haven't taken the evals yet.
2412,I feel that the instructors care deeply but do to the pass rate
2413,"At times the scenarios have so much new information being presented at one time that it makes it difficult to really focus and absorb what should be happening. It would also be beneficial if after the scenario, the students would be able to maybe experience the problem again with a"
2414,Joe Stapleton was extremely helpful during the course.
2415,"Joe was sometimes prone to digress into anecdotes unrelated to ATC, specifically the Kabul story. A more litigious class might have filed an official complaint, and Joe is too good an instructor to have him get in trouble over a minor story."
2416,Switch one week of basics for one more week of radar/non-radar.
2417,We'll talk Thursday afternoon.
2418,"More lab time, less basics time."
2419,The course would better serve an employee who actually works with appropriations. The content was very detailed and I felt it did no apply to FSDO level funds certification.
2420,The course would better serve an employee who actually works with appropriations. The content was very detailed and I felt it did no apply to FSDO level funds certification.
2421,Very little content applied directly to the job I perform as a FSDO level funds certifier.
2422,I found all of the PAW classes very good and useful in the office.
2423,My instructors Rich Green and Rich Wiggins were wonderful. They were very knowledgeable and made the material easy to understand. If they did not know an answer they always went to double check before giving us an answer.
2424,It would've been nice if CKT 1 was not the day before nonradar evals.
2425,NOT ENOUGH LAB TIME PER STUDENT. THE TIME ALLOTTED IN LAB PER STUDENT IS INADEQUATE FOR THE EXPECTED PEFORMANCE. INORDER TO MEET AND EXCEED THE SKILLS NEEDED FOR SATISFACOTORY PERFOMANCE STUDENT NEED MORE TIME TO DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS.
2426,Would have liked more of an availability to talk individually to the instructors on a one on one basis
2427,"The majority were, but some of the material is not up to date with the 7110"
2428,The course is obviously set up for a fast pace environment but this was very high pace felt like I could succeed more and be a better employee if given more time to develop
2429,Some lessons were scheduled for to much time.
2430,I was already a SR. Technical manager in the private sector plus military leadership training.YOu need a class for incoming managers with the 20 years of experience that I brought with me.
2431,"Mostly repeats of past material and nothing went into depth enough.I am not a New manager, 25 years of managing and leading."
2432,Too early to assess
2433,"I understand that budgets are tight and that elongated training is expensive, but I think we should have spent more time with practice scenarios and how to handle them. This would require more time, especially if we did more group role playing and analysis."
2434,"Noel was not a new manager. He was formerly a manager, but had an intermission where he became a non-manager for a while. His management skills were not lost when he returned to management, but the training certainly did bring him up to today's management processes."
2435,CKT 2 had a question where the right answer had a B757 as H/B757. It was confusing to the people that knew that the B757 is no longer considered a heavy.
2436,I wish we had more time in radar training than nonradar training. It does not make sense that 66% of our grade is dependent on the 20% of our time we spent in the radar lab while we were at the academy.
2437,I wish we had less academics and more time in the actual labs.
2438,I think the training would be more effective if we spent less time in the books and if we spent more time in the labs.
2439,It makes it very difficult to study radar when there is nowhere you can practice running problems.
2440,"Some of the pilot and controller remotes are absolutely unacceptable. Some of them don't talk clear or concise, or are very slow at replying or even understanding what to do when we give them instructions. R-Sides and instructors are great. I really liked working with Joseph (Young"
2441,Sometimes was noisy when other students not finished with testing/quizzing. Other students did not sit quietly while waiting.
2442,"Sometimes some lesson plans were rushed, pages not read over."
2443,"I understand the need for fast paced practice scenarios. When 66% of the grade is riding on only around 3 weeks of 3 practice problems a day, there could have been more focus on running problems. I think it would be beneficial to allow students to watch other students run in the ea"
2444,"I can't answer this honestly, since we have not evaluated yet."
2445,In reference to radar: Finding correct phraseology and acceptable phrases to give information to the r-side within the text was difficult. Material similar the phraseology chart in non-radar would be extremely helpful.
2446,"I felt that the overall pace of the course was rushed, especially for a portion worth the heavier portion of our ""grade"""
2447,"This class is the same as the Air Carrier AW Practical App Workshop and since I have already been I the agency for 6 years, this class has not helped in any way."
2448,"This class is the same as the Air Carrier AW Practical App Workshop and since I have already been I the agency for 6 years, this class has not helped in any way."
2449,"This class is the same as the Air Carrier AW Practical App Workshop and since I have already been I the agency for 6 years, this class has not helped in any way."
2450,"This class is the same as the Air Carrier AW Practical App Workshop and since I have already been I the agency for 6 years, this class has not helped in any way."
2451,"This class is the same as the Air Carrier AW Practical App Workshop and since I have already been I the agency for 6 years, this class has not helped in any way."
2452,There were times the materials referenced a book used in the old CCCH program. There were times the materials needed to be updated and the instructors claimed any changes needed to go though hurdles which seems very unnecessary.
2453,"The SOC will need to be comfortable looking at an active sector's airspace on an R-Side/D-side console to determine degradation. There should be more focus on understand how to manipulate and feel comfortable with data blocks, flight plans, maps, charts, fixes, and general R-Side m"
2454,Going into the lab to understand theory should be more available. There were times in the lecture that the material would be better understood if we walked over to the lab and saw an idea in application. The current organization treats class time and lab time as 2 separate experien

2456,This was the best part of the class. A genuine challenge.
2457,There were times that a processor should have been swapped out with a spare to experience the real remove name/role functions. It would be easy to do and add much more for the students.
2458,"The charts were out dated and did not reflect the labs. There are labs in which we follow a flight plan through fixes. The charts at the sector should show the fixes we are following to enhance our learning. We should follow flight plans through high altitude and low altitude, in b"
2459,The contractor spoke a little too fast and often times got himself confused trying to explain theory or answer a student question.
2460,this course could easily be cut down by a couple days
2461,"I've got one really big issue with the first test; the cable question. When you ask what is the most commonly used cable, the answer is RG214 because its the most available is NOT a by the book answer. You stress all the answers are in the JO's and TI's, but than you have a reason"
2462,"Shon, Jim, and Randy were all very helpful and I really enjoyed having them as instuctors."
2463,Particularly liked the Performance Exam.
2464,"This individual had extensive management experience entering the agency so possessed many of the skills taught in this class already. However, I do see a marked improvement on government specific matters."
2465,I was very satisfied. Above responses don't really answer the question.
2466,"Teach at an excruciatingly high level...as engineer. In the field, maintenance has been spread further and further out...making maintaining profieciency difficult to maintain. Also the system is designed now to call second level."
2467,see above...also have not yet been assigned a site and I am currently at the academy.
2468,the last couple weks yes...system specific data.
2469,see above
2470,"Minor changes need to be made to slides, but that's about it. The instructor was very aware and ensured the class had the correct materials/resources."
2471,Some of the labs seem unreasonably detailed. Accessing and annotating settings on CM-300 v2 radios didn't seem to serve a purpose.
2472,Feeling proficient now...maintaining that proficiency when returning to the field is a different story when maintenance is only conducted once a year.
2473,The course was paced well it just needed to be longer with more of an opportunity to work on the equipment.
2474,The Instructor would interrupt lab time and get lost in tangent making the procedure even more confusing than originally initiated.
2475,The course needs to be longer for more practice and troubleshooting portion.
2476,No EBUS Training.
2477,The instructors are very knowledgeable about ERAM hardware and software functions. Our job at the SOC requires knowledge the R-Side/D-side capabilities. More time should be paid attention to learning and manipulating the R-Side/D-side consoles.
2478,Module 6's introduction to radar inputs is very lengthy. The time would be better spent actually going out to an radar site on the campus. You could spend the same amount of time and the students would earn a unique perspective.
2479,Shon and Jim are assets to this organization.
2480,"I have not yet been able to get any work load in SAS, mock site was not helpful."
2481,I am not sure I will use all the math that is being taught.
2482,I would like more theroy into how the the system works. VOR is a very hard subject to understand and I am not sure that much math is helping me.
2483,I learned the majority of what was presented in this course in Professional Military Education received while on active duty.
2484,I learned the majority of what was presented in this course in Professional Military Education received while on active duty and have applied them since that time.
2485,"If anything, the training was a refresher."
2486,"Again, if anything, it was a refresher."
2487,"The scale categories for this question should incorporate the terms satisfied or dis-satisfied. I was dis-satisfied even though the description of the course stated it was not technical, the name of the course still gives one the impression it deals with things specifically needed"
2488,I have not had the opportunity to use these skills
2489,I have not had the opportunity to use these skills
2490,"It has given me a few additional tools to work with, but does not effect my performance."
2491,I feel that there should have been more information on how to perform and conduct an inspection of an operator that conducts Nondestructive Inspection.
2492,mainly covered 121 operations. Very little useful to GA opns.
2493,mainly covered 121 operations. Very little useful to GA opns
2494,mainly covered 121 operations. Very little useful to GA opns
2495,mainly covered 121 operations. Very little useful to GA opns
2496,mainly covered 121 operations. Very little useful to GA opns. One of the worst courses at MMAC.
2497,"I already possess this knowledge and these skills, I did not learn anything new."
2498,I did not learn anything useful from this course.
2499,This course has had no effect on my job performance.
2500,This course was a waste of my time and agency funds. The time and funds could have been much more effectively utilized for other training.
2501,"The instructors were excellent, they were very knowledgeable about the topic and course content. They did a very effective job of teaching the course. The course content was useless to me. I was very dissatisfied, it was a complete waste of my time."
2502,"I served in the military for over 20 years and I feel that I have utilized most of these skills throughout my career, both as a young enlisted soldier to a senior Warrant Officer leader."
2503,The course was purely theory. There was little to no practical application to improve my skills as a principal.
2504,I don't feel as though I took anything away from the course to apply.
2505,"Again, no useful skills or knowledge were obtained to improve performance."
2506,We have no operators that use a SMS.
2507,"As a 50 year old retired military officer, if I haven't developed the skills to interact with other humans by this point, this course is not going to change that. Three days of theory were not beneficial to me."
2508,"I can sum up the course in one statement. Upon completion, the entire class was verbose in their displeasure. The response we received was: ""it may not be what you expected, or even what you wanted, but I think it was what you needed"". I nearly fell out of my chair. The irony in th"
